#+title: (justine.lol) SectorLISP Now Fits in One Sector
#+filetags: :lisp:blog_post:website:

#+begin_quote
  The [[https://github.com/jart/sectorlisp][SectorLISP]] project has achieved its goal of creating a LISP that's tiny enough to fit in the master boot sector of a floppy disk.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the tiniest LISP to date.  Since a master boot record is only 512 bytes, that means LISP is now tied with [[https://github.com/cesarblum/sectorforth][FORTH]] to be the most lightweight high-level programming language in the world.
