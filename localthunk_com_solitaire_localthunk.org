  * Solitaire

  I have cited a few games as inspiration for Balatro in the past, but I wanted to talk about one in particular that hasn't been mentioned much that arguably is the most important.

  I think if I had some kind of Balatro vision board, solitaire (Klondike) would be right in the middle of it with a big red circle around it.  You can probably see some of the similarities between my game and the classic solo card game.  I wanted my game to have the same vibe.
