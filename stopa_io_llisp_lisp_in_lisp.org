  * LLisp: Lisp in Lisp

  January 2022

  Last week I had a thought: â€œWhat's the simplest Lisp interpreter I could write, which supports macros?"

  A weekend of Clojure hacking and some confusion later, a REPL was born.  In this essay, we'll go through the same journey and make our own Lisp interpreter, which supports macros...in Clojure!  Let's call it, LLisp: a lisp in a lisp.

  By the end, you'll write your own macros in your own darn programming language!  Let's get into it.
