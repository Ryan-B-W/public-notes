#+title: (github.com) emacs-evil/evil-cleverparens: Evil normal-state minor-mode for editing lisp-like languages
#+filetags: :emacs_lisp:lisp:emacs:software:website:

A solid package for making [[id:aca1324c-b142-4e34-a121-a8bb0a79ddf8][Emacs]] [[id:a5094857-0ab6-4566-b32d-6cb9adae21fc][Evil Mode]] play nice with [[id:8278042c-72a7-4eac-806f-e369ffdd82c3][Smartparens]].  It even provides [[id:37c53f5b-c586-41ff-a4fe-b44c05ed3c1f][Vim]] text objects.

#+begin_quote
  evil-cleverparens is modal-editing optimized for editing Lisp.  It works under the following principles:
   1. Act like Vim/evil where useful, but prevent actions that would throw the order of your parentheses and other delimiters into question.
   2. Make the most out of the combination of structural and modal editing.
   3. Provide but don't force additional features on the user.
