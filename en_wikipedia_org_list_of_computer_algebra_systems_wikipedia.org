  The following tables provide a *comparison of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system][computer algebra systems]]* (CAS).  A CAS is a package comprising a set of algorithms for performing symbolic manipulations on algebraic objects, a language to implement them, and an environment in which to use the language.  A CAS may include a user interface and graphics capability; and to be effective may require a large library of algorithms, efficient data structures and a fast kernel.
