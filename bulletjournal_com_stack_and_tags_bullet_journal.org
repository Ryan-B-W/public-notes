  /*Some new BuJo vocabulary to help us communicate*/

  The Bullet JournalÂ® was always designed to be modular.  Each module is designed to group related information, that is why the modules are called Collections.

  Everything inside the Bullet Journal is a type of Collection.  The core Collections are: The Index, The Future Log, Monthly Log, and the Daily Log.  Other popular Collections include: Weekly Log, Food Log, Trackers, Mood Logs, and Gratitude Logs.

  The beautiful thing about the Bullet Journal is that you have the freedom to mix and match which Collections you use to power your practice.

  Like Legos, our Collections can be assembled in many different ways.  Till now there has been no term for your collection of, well, Collections.  With that in mind, I would like to introduce you to a new term in our vocabulary: the Bullet Journal Stack.  So what's a Stack?

  We often test out different types of Collections to see which work, and which don't.  The ones that do work, get added to our Stack.  A Stack simply refers to the active Collections in our Bullet Journal.
