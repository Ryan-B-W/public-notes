  ** About

  =eyebrowse= is a global minor mode for Emacs that allows you to manage your window configurations in a simple manner, just like tiling window managers like i3wm with their workspaces do.  It displays their current state in the modeline by default.  The behaviour is modeled after [[https://ranger.github.io/][ranger]], a file manager written in Python.
