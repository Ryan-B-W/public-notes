  * Sentiment analysis tuber part 2

  In my [[https://peetseater.space/blag/2025-02-01-sentiment-analysis-tuber.html][previous post]] we got a proof of concept for taking in speech and converting it into actions to display specific images in OBS up and running. Much like regular software development, an MVP is a work meant to flush out ideas and then to be thrown away or refactored into the base of a project. So today, we're going to take what we learned, refactor it into a framework, and then add some enhancements to start turning a POC into a useful application.
