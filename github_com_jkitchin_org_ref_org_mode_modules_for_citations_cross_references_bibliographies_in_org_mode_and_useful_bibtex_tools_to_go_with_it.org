  org-ref makes it easy to insert citations, cross-references, indexes and glossaries as hyper-functional links into org files.  The links are fontified so you can tell them apart from other links, and each link is clickable to access functions like opening a pdf, notes or url associated with the link.  Each link also can be exported to LaTeX to build a PDF.  For citations, export to other formats is supported by citeproc for high quality export to HTML, markdown, plain text, or stand-alone (i.e. independent of a bibtex file) LaTeX.  For a full explanation of the features in org-ref see ./org-ref.org.
