  This is an absurd project.

  It implements a backend for sql.js (sqlite3 compiled for the web) that treats IndexedDB like a disk and stores data in blocks there. That means your sqlite3 database is persisted. And not in the terrible way of reading and writing the whole image at once -- it reads and writes your db in small chunks.

  It basically stores a whole database into another database. Which is absurd.

  See the demo. You can also view an entire app using this here.

  You should also read this blog post which explains the project in great detail.

  If you like my work, feel free to buy me a coffee!
