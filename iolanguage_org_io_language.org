#+begin_quote
  Io is a programming language focused on expressiveness through simplicity.

  inspirations:   Self, Lua, Smalltalk, NewtonScript, Act1, LISP
  pure:           minimal syntax
                  all values are objects
                  prototype-based object model
                  everything is a message, even assignment
                  no keywords, no globals
  dynamic:        all messages are dynamic
                  code is a runtime modifiable tree of messages
                  arguments passed by expression, receiver controls eval
                  differential inheritance
                  become, transparent proxies, weak links
  concurrent:     coroutine based actors
                  transparent futures
                  automatic lock detection
  implementation: small
                  open source
                  embeddable
                  multi-state
                  incremental collector
