  John McCarthy, the inventor of Lisp, died on October 23, 2011.  In his honor we will implement a Lisp interpreter in today’s exercise.  He first described Lisp in an academic paper, and the LISP 1.5 Programmer’s Manual, published in 1962 but still in print, is an early definition of the language (the LISP 1.0 manual by Patricia Fox was dated 1960, which is usually cited as the birth year of Lisp, even though Lisp was formally specified as early as 1958).  McCarthy defines the eval/apply yin/yang that is at the heart of Lisp on page 13, in what Alan Kay described as the Maxwell’s equations of software.
