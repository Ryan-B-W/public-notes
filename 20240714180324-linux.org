Linux is an [[id:a3c19488-876c-4b17-81c0-67b9c7fc64ee][open-source]] [[id:925a80bf-d4d4-4061-9ac1-2d0224e1590a][kernel]] for building an [[id:412bbcad-6c00-4f13-b748-d1ffde0588e1][operating system]] on top of originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as free alternative to [[id:b7ffa33f-6da2-4918-9ced-6afd0fbdb0fe][Unix]].

  *Linux* ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English][/ˈlɪnʊks/]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key][/LIN-uuks/]]) is a family of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source][open-source]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like][Unix-like]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system][operating systems]] based on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel][Linux kernel]], an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)][operating system kernel]] first released on September 17, 1991, by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds][Linus Torvalds]].  Linux is typically [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager][packaged]] as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution][Linux distribution]] (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_software][system software]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)][libraries]]—most of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system, designed as a clone of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix][Unix]] and released under the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft][copyleft]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL][GPL]] license.

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions][Thousands of Linux distributions]] exist, many based directly or indirectly on other distributions; popular Linux distributions include [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian][Debian]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_Linux][Fedora Linux]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Mint][Linux Mint]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux][Arch Linux]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu][Ubuntu]], while commercial distributions include [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux][Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE_Linux_Enterprise][SUSE Linux Enterprise]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromeOS][ChromeOS]].  Linux distributions are frequently used in server platforms.  Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation][Free Software Foundation]] uses and recommends the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the use and importance of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU][GNU]] software in many distributions, causing some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy][controversy]].  Other than the Linux kernel, key components that make up a distribution may include a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_server][display server (windowing system)]], a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager][package manager]], a bootloader and a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell][Unix shell]].

  Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software][software]] collaboration.  While originally developed for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86][x86]] based [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer][personal computers]], it has since been [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting][ported]] to more [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware_platforms][platforms]] than any other operating system, and is used on a wide variety of devices including PCs, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstations][workstations]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframes][mainframes]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system][embedded systems]].  Linux is the predominant operating system for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)][servers]] and is also used on all of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500][world's 500 fastest supercomputers]].  When combined with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)][Android]], which is Linux-based and designed for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone][smartphones]], they have the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems][largest installed base]] of all [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_operating_system][general-purpose operating systems]].
