  Besides powering iPhone, iOS is the basis for three other [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_operating_systems][operating systems made by Apple]]: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS][iPadOS]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvOS][tvOS]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOS][watchOS]].  iOS formerly also powered [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad][iPads]] until iPadOS was introduced in 2019 and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch][iPod Touch]] line of devices until its discontinuation.  iOS is the world's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems][second most widely installed mobile operating system]], after [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)][Android]].  As of December 2023, Apple's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS)][App Store]] contains more than 3.8 million iOS [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_apps][mobile apps]].

  iOS is based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS][macOS]].  Like macOS, it includes components of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)][Mach]] microkernel and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD][FreeBSD]].
