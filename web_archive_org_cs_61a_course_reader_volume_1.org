  * CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

  *** Course Reader, Volume 1: Semester Assignments

  ** *Berkeley students: Do not print or use these pages!  They do not have the dates for the current semester, so they won't help you.  They are here for non-Berkeley people.  ESPECIALLY DON'T LOOK HERE FOR THE PROGRAMMING PROJECTS, WHICH ARE DIFFERENT HERE FROM THE CURRENT ONES!*

  For many years I resisted the trend to putting course materials online, but I've been convinced because of the increasing numbers of people who aren't at Berkeley but use the [[http://wla.berkeley.edu/main.php?course=cs61a][online lectures]] to study SICP.  Welcome, visitors!  Our course reader is divided into two volumes, this small one with semester-varying material, and [[https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~cs61a/reader/vol2.html][Volume 2]], with unchanging reference material, so that our students can buy used copies of Volume 2, and only need new copies of Volume 1. What's online has the dates removed.  *Also, the projects vary somewhat from semester to semester, so what you see here is only approximately what's current -- I don't update the online version.*
