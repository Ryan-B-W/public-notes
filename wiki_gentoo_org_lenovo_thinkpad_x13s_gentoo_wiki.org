  The *Lenovo ThinkPad X13s* is an ARM64 based laptop with good support under Linux and Gentoo.  Most features work flawlessly with a few still being under active development.  For details on the support of each feature check [[https://github.com/jhovold/linux/wiki/X13s][this page]].

  This laptop isn't the fastest ever, but performs well and gets 12-16 hours of battery life under normal use conditions.
