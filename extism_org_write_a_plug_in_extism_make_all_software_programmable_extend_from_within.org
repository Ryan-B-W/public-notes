  * Quickstart

  The following is a minimal guide to running writing an Extism plug-in in your language of choice.  This document should get you from =0= to ="Hello, World!"= as quickly as possible.

  ** Choose A Language

  In Extism, your plug-in code is compiled to a binary Wasm module.  We offer a variety of libraries, which we call PDKs (Plug-in Development Kits), to help you compile your code to a Wasm module that can be embedded in any Host SDK.
