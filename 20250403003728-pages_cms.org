  ** Frequently asked questions

  Is Pages CMS free?

  Yes, Pages CMS is 100% free, whether you want to use [[https://app.pagescms.org/][the online version]], deploy it for free on [[https://vercel.com/][Vercel]], or self-host it.  It's MIT licensed through and through, feel free to extend it as you see fit.

  Do you only support GitHub?

  Yes.  Supposedly, we could add GitLab and Bitbucket support, but the assumption is the vast majority of users will be on GitHub.  Pull requests and issues are welcome: [[https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms][github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms]].

  Why yet another CMS?

  I hear you, but I needed Pages CMS to exist.  I love static site generators, and while YAML front matter and Markdown aren't terribly complicated, editing content and uploading images using GitHub.com or Git isn't really user-friendly, especially if you're updating the site with a whole team.  For that reason, a lot of teams use a headless CMS like Contentful, Sanity, or Strapi.  That works, but it's one more dependency and is overkill in most cases.  You could also use something like Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS). Really cool project, but I've never been a fan of the user experience.  And most importantly, I wanted something as simple as possible.  Back in 2018, I had built a lightweight CMS ([[https://github.com/hunvreus/jekyllplus][Jekyll+]]) with the idea of getting the CMS set up with a single configuration file.  Pages CMS is the next iteration of that idea.

  Who made this?  It sucks!

  I did: [[https://ronanberder.com/][Ronan Berder]] ([[https://x.com/hunvreus][@hunvreus]]). I'm a half-decent developer, but I sure could use some help to make this suck less: [[https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms][github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms]].
