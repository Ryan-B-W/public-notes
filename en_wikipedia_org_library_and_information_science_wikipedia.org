  *Library and Information Science* (*LIS*) are two interconnected disciplines that deal with information management.  This includes organization, access, collection, and regulation of information, both in physical and digital forms.

  Library science and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science][information science]] are two original disciplines; however, they are within the same field of study.  Library science is applied information science.  Library science is both an application and a subfield of information science.  Due to the strong connection, sometimes the two terms are used synonymously.
