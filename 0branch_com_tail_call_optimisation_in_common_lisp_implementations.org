#+title: (0branch.com) Tail Call Optimisation in Common Lisp Implementations
#+filetags: :programming_language_design:lisp:programming:website:

An article on guarantees of tail-call elimination in various [[id:b5fb5c4b-d10f-4bca-91e1-a5e946ef0c83][Common Lisp]] implementations.

For SBCL, the following is the constraints on when tail-call elimination is done for both self-calls and general tail-calls:
: Tail-merging is done if (> SPACE DEBUG) or (> SPEED DEBUG) â€“ not by default.
