  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics][mathematics]], *Monte Carlo integration* is a technique for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_quadrature][numerical integration]] using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness][random numbers]].  It is a particular [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method][Monte Carlo method]] that numerically computes a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_integral][definite integral]].  While other algorithms usually evaluate the integrand at a regular grid, Monte Carlo randomly chooses points at which the integrand is evaluated.  This method is particularly useful for higher-dimensional integrals.

  There are different methods to perform a Monte Carlo integration, such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)][uniform sampling]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling][stratified sampling]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_sampling][importance sampling]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter][sequential Monte Carlo]] (also known as a particle filter), and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean-field_particle_methods][mean-field particle methods]].
