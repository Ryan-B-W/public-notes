  * Interactive IPA Chart

  The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet][International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) is a set of symbols that linguists use to describe the sounds of spoken languages.

  This page lets you hear the sounds that the symbols represent, but remember that it is only a rough guide.  There is lots of variation in how these sounds are said depending on the language and context.  For example, in English voiceless plosives usually end with a puff of air called /aspiration/, but the voiceless plosives on this page aren't aspirated.
