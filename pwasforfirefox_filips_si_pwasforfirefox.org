  Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use web APIs and features along with progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications.  Although [[id:11f55adb-3785-4f14-9de5-719fde4906b8][Firefox]] supports many of Progressive Web App APIs, it does not support functionality to install them as a standalone system app with an app-like experience.  This functionality is often also known as a Site Specific Browser (SSB).
  This project creates a custom modified Firefox runtime to allow websites to be installed as standalone apps and provides a console tool and browser extension to install, manage and use them.
