  --------------

  Sometimes I get asked by various people on how this blog works. How do I actually blog with the amazing sorcerous powers of Emacs? In my mission of knowledge sharing, I will show you my workflow and tricks today. Hopefully it can be useful for you as well.

  My blog has evolved through the years, and will probably continue doing so. More tasks can probably be automated, as I have already automated many menial tasks (e.g, promoting a draft by giving it a date in the filename). I know the blog is far from perfect, but it is a comfortable environment to work in. Being able to not leave my Emacs setup for long periods of time ðŸ©·

  : "Emacs started out as an extensible text editor program that I had written, which become over the years a way of life for many users, as it was extended so much they could do all their computing without ever leaving Emacs." - Richard Stallman
