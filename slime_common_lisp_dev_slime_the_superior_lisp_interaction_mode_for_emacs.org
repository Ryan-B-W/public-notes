  ** SLIME: The Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs

  SLIME is a Emacs mode for Common Lisp development.  Inspired by existing systems such Emacs Lisp and ILISP, we are working to create an environment for hacking Common Lisp in.

  This frugal page is an invitation to learn more about what's going on.

  *** feature highlights

  - *slime-mode*: An Emacs minor-mode to enhance lisp-mode with:
    - Code evaluation, compilation, and macroexpansion.
    - Online documentation (describe, apropos, hyperspec).
    - Definition finding (aka Meta-Point aka M-.).
    - Symbol and package name completion.
    - Automatic macro indentation based on =&body=.
    - Cross-reference interface (WHO-CALLS, etc).
    - ... and more.
  - *SLDB*: Common Lisp debugger with an Emacs-based user interface.
  - *REPL*: The Read-Eval-Print Loop ("top-level") is written in Emacs Lisp for tighter integration with Emacs.  The REPL also has builtin "shortcut" commands similar those of the McCLIM listener.
  - *Compilation notes*: SLIME is able to take compiler messages and annotate them directly into source buffers.
  - *Inspector*: Interactive object-inspector in an Emacs buffer.

  *** supported platforms

  SLIME works with GNU Emacs versions 24.3 and later, on Linux, macOS, Windows, *BSD, Unix.

  The currently supported Common Lisp implementations are:

  - CMU Common Lisp (CMUCL)
  - Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL)
  - Clozure CL (a.k.a. OpenMCL)
  - LispWorks
  - Allegro CL
  - CLISP
  - Scieneer CL
  - ECL
  - Corman CL
  - ABCL
  - Clasp
