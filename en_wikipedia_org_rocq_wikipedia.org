  The *Rocq Prover* (formerly named *Coq*) is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant][interactive theorem prover]] first released in 1989.  It allows the expression of mathematical assertions, mechanical checking of proofs of these assertions, assists in finding [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_proof][formal proofs]] using proof automation routines and extraction of a certified program from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof][constructive proof]] of its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_specification][formal specification]].

  Rocq works within the theory of the /calculus of inductive constructions/, a derivative of the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_constructions][calculus of constructions]]/.  Rocq is not an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_prover][automated theorem prover]] but includes automatic theorem proving tactics ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine][procedures]]) and various [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)][decision]] procedures.
