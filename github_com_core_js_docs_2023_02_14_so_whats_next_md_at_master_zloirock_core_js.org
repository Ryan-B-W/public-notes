  * So, what's next?

  Hi.  I am (*[[https://github.com/zloirock][@zloirock]]*), a full-time open-source developer.  I don't like to write long posts, but it seems it is high time to do it.  Initially, this post was supposed to be a post about the start of active development of the new major version of =core-js= and the roadmap (it was moved to [[https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/docs/2023-02-14-so-whats-next.md#roadmap][the second half]]), however, due to recent events, it became a really long post about many different things... I'm fucking tired.  Free open-source software is fundamentally broken.  I could stop working on this silently, but I want to give open-source one last chance.
