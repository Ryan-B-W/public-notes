#+title: (orgmode.org) org-depend.el â€“ TODO dependencies for Org-mode
#+filetags: :emacs:software:website:

#+begin_quote
  org-depend.el demonstrates a mechanism for creating TODO dependencies.  Note that [[id:5ab4a0b0-95e2-40cf-b924-709db3115d48][Org-mode]] does already have built-in local dependencies which are simpler and cover most of what one usually wants to do.  However, the built-in implementation covers only the following two concepts:
   - blocking an entry from changing its state to DONE while it still has children that are not done, or checkboxes that are unchecked
   - blocking an entry from changing its state to DONE while it still has un-done siblings above it, in this way enforcing sequential work on the siblings
  org-depend.el was originally a proof-of-concept implementation of TODO dependencies, using two special hooks, org-blocker-hook and org-trigger-hook.  It remains in the distribution as an example on how more complex dependencies between entries can be implemented.  In particular it shows how to implement the following:
   - Dependencies on remote entries identified by ID.  These entries do not have to be near-by and may even be located in a different file.
   - The possibility to trigger actions in other entries.
