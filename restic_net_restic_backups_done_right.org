  * Introduction

  Restic is a modern backup program that can back up your files:

  - from *Linux, BSD, Mac and Windows*

  - to *many different storage types*, including self-hosted and online services

  - *easily*, being a single executable that you can run without a server or complex setup

  - *effectively*, only transferring the parts that actually changed in the files you back up

  - *securely*, by careful use of cryptography in every part of the process

  - *verifiably*, enabling you to make sure that your files can be restored when needed

  - *freely* - restic is entirely free to use and completely open source
