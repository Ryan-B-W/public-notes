  Found that on seeking alpha:

  A research paper written by several researchers at the University of Wisconsin, and presented at the IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture, came to the following conclusions with respect to the ARM/X86 myth:

  Performance differences are generated by ISA-independent microarchitecture differences
  The energy consumption is again ISA-independent.
  ISA differences have implementation implications, but modern microarchitecture techniques render them moot; one ISA is not fundamentally more efficient.
  ARM and x86 implementations are simply design points optimized for different performance levels
