  * Modern C++ book recommendations.

  Hey, i just finished Bjarne's programming principles C++ book, i want to go into more advanced texts that teach standard practices(i don't mean for specifics like templates, functional programming etc.), i found some by Scott Meyers and Herb Sutter, but they are pre C++11, and we are already going to 26, so i am guessing they are outdated, but if they aren't please mention it.

  Any books recommendations by decent authors would be fine, thanks.
