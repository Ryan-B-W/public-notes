  If you want to get a job as a software witch, you're going to have to pass a whiteboard interview.  We all do them, as engineers--often as a part of our morning ritual, along with arranging a beautiful grid of xterms across the astral plane, and compulsively running ls in every nearby directory--just in case things have shifted during the night--the incorporeal equivalent of rummaging through that drawer in the back of the kitchen where we stash odd flanges, screwdrivers, and the strangely specific plastic bits: the accessories, those long-estranged black sheep of the families of our household appliances, their original purpose now forgotten, perhaps never known, but which we are bound to care for nonetheless.  I'd like to walk you through a common interview question: reversing a linked list.
