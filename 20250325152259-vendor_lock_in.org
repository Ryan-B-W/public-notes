  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics][economics]], *vendor lock-in*, also known as *proprietary lock-in* or *customer lock-in*, makes a customer dependent on a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor][vendor]] for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)][products]], unable to use another vendor without substantial [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switching_barriers][switching costs]].

  The use of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard][open standards]] and alternative options makes systems tolerant of change, so that decisions can be postponed until more information is available or unforeseen events are addressed.  Vendor lock-in does the opposite: it makes it difficult to move from one solution to another.

  Lock-in costs that create [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers_to_entry][barriers to market entry]] may result in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law][antitrust]] action against a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly][monopoly]].
