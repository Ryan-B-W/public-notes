  * Circuits are better animated

  ** EveryCircuit is an online and mobile app to design, simulate, share, and discover electronic circuits.

  2.6 M circuits made in EveryCircuit

  Easy animated interactive simulation

  *** Visualize

  One animated circuit is worth a thousand equations and diagrams.  Animations of voltages, currents, and charges are displayed right on top of schematic, providing great insight into circuit operation.

  *** Simulate

  Real-time circuit simulation engine is custom-built for speed and interactivity.  Easy one-click simulation, from simple resistors and logic gates, to complex transistor-level oscillators and mixed-signal designs.

  *** Interact

  While simulation is running, you can flip switches, adjust potentiometers, tune LED current limiting resistors, ramp up input voltages, etc.  The circuit will immediately respond to your changes, in real time.

  * Features powerful and beautiful

  ** Circuits come alive with uninterrupted flow of simulation data.  Dynamic oscilloscope opens new angles for circuit analysis.

  *** Analog and digital circuits

  Mini-waveforms on top of schemaic wires look different for digital and analog signals.  Constant analog voltages are shown as numbers, digital wires are color-coded.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.

  *** I-V curve characteristics

  Family of I-V curves for a MOSFET transistor are obtained by stepping the gate voltage.  Notice how linear and saturation regions are visualized inside the MOSFET symbol.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.

  *** AC analysis with Bode plot

  Frequency response changes when circuit is modified.  Phases and magnitudes are shown in schematic as circles.  Notice them change as the frequency trace is moved.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.

  *** Oscillator orbit evolution

  Any pair of time-domain signals may be plotted in the XY mode.  The oscilloscope scale and grid ticks are auto-updated to convenient values as the data changes.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.

  ** Analog and digital components can be simulated together in one circuit.
