#+title: Shamir's Secret Sharing
#+filetags: :security:mathematics:computer_science:cryptography:

A secret sharing scheme for sharing a secret among a group with perfect secrecy below a certain threshold of the group's pieces of information being held by a single party.  Invented by [[id:7cf931f8-5095-4473-8010-b94ed35b914d][Adi Shamir]].

  *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir][Shamir's]] secret sharing* (SSS) is an efficient [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing][secret sharing]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm][algorithm]] for distributing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing][private information]] (the "secret") among a group.  The secret cannot be revealed unless a minimum number of the group's members act together to pool their knowledge.  To achieve this, the secret is mathematically divided into parts (the "shares") from which the secret can be reassembled only when a sufficient number of shares are combined.  SSS has the property of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-theoretic_security][information-theoretic security]], meaning that even if an attacker steals some shares, it is impossible for the attacker to reconstruct the secret unless they have stolen a sufficient number of shares.

  Shamir's secret sharing is used in some applications to share the access keys to a master secret.
