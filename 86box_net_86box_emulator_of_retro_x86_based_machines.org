  *86Box* is a low level x86 emulator that runs older operating systems and software designed for IBM PC systems and compatibles from 1981 through fairly recent system designs based on the PCI bus.

  *** Features

  - Easy to use interface inspired by mainstream hypervisor software
  - Low level emulation of 8086-based processors up to the Pentium with focus on accuracy
  - Great range of customizability of virtual machines
  - Many available systems, such as the very first IBM PC 5150 from 1981, or the more obscure IBM PS/2 line of systems based on the Micro Channel Architecture
  - Lots of supported peripherals including video adapters, sound cards, network adapters, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters
  - MIDI output to Windows built-in MIDI support, FluidSynth, or emulated Roland synthesizers
  - Supports running MS-DOS, older Windows versions, OS/2, many Linux distributions, or vintage systems such as BeOS or NEXTSTEP, and applications for these systems
