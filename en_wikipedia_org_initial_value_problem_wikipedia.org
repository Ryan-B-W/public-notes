  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus][multivariable calculus]], an *initial value problem* (*IVP*) is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation][ordinary differential equation]] together with an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_condition][initial condition]] which specifies the value of the unknown [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)][function]] at a given point in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function][domain]].  Modeling a system in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics][physics]] or other sciences frequently amounts to solving an initial value problem.  In that context, the differential initial value is an equation which specifies how the system [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_evolution][evolves with time]] given the initial conditions of the problem.
