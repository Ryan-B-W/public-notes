  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing][computing]], *memoization* or *memoisation* is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_(computer_science)][optimization]] technique used primarily to speed up [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programs][computer programs]] by storing the results of expensive [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine][function calls]] to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function][pure functions]] and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.  Memoization has also been used in other contexts (and for purposes other than speed gains), such as in simple [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_recursion][mutually recursive]] descent parsing.  It is a type of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)][caching]], distinct from other forms of caching such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_(computer_science)][buffering]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm][page replacement]]. In the context of some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming][logic programming]] languages, memoization is also known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabling][tabling]].
