#+title: (datatracker.ietf.org) draft-rivest-sexp-xx - SPKI S-Expressions
#+filetags: :draft:sexp:ietf:specification:rfc:website:

#+begin_quote
  This memo specifies a data structure representation that is suitable for representing arbitrary, complex data structures.  It was devised in 1996/1997 to support SPKI (RFC 2692) certificates with the intent that it be more widely applicable.  It has been and is being used elsewhere.  There are many implementations in a variety of programming languages.  Uses of this representation herein are referred to as "S-expressions".  This memo makes precise the encodings of these S-expressions: it gives a "canonical form" for them, describes two "transport" representations, and also describe an "advanced" format for display to people.
