  * CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

  *** Course Reader, Volume 2: Reference Documents

  *These documents are here for online reference!  Please do not print these on the printers in Berkeley computer labs.  Lab printers are for your homework and project solutions, not for reference documents.  Thank you.*

  For many years I resisted the trend to putting course materials online, but I've been convinced because of the increasing numbers of people who aren't at Berkeley but use the [[http://wla.berkeley.edu/main.php?course=cs61a][online lectures]] to study SICP.  Welcome, visitors!

  - Sample Exams:
    - *Please read this:*

      These exams are made up of actual past exam questions, but reorganized to make each sample more comprehensive and to choose the best possible questions.  Some of the exams are a little longer (by one question) than actual exams, but they're in the right ballpark.

      Since the questions within a sample are taken from different semesters, don't try to compare the number of points between problems.  The solutions include scoring information only to give you an idea of how part credit is awarded within each problem.
