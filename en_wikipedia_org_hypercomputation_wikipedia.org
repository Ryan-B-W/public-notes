  *Hypercomputation* or *super-Turing computation* is a set of hypothetical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation][models of computation]] that can provide outputs that are not [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-computable][Turing-computable]].  For example, a machine that could solve the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem][halting problem]] would be a hypercomputer; so too would one that could [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem][correctly evaluate every statement]] in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_arithmetic][Peano arithmetic]].

  The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchâ€“Turing_thesis][Church--Turing thesis]] states that any "computable" function that can be computed by a mathematician with a pen and paper using a finite set of simple algorithms, can be computed by a Turing machine.  Hypercomputers compute functions that a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine][Turing machine]] cannot and which are, hence, not computable in the Church--Turing sense.

  Technically, the output of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Turing_machine][random Turing machine]] is uncomputable; however, most hypercomputing literature focuses instead on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation][computation]] of deterministic, rather than random, uncomputable functions.
