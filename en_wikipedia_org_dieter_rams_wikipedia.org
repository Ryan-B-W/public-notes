  Dieter Rams (born 20 May 1932) is a German industrial designer who is most closely associated with the consumer products company Braun, the furniture company Vits≈ì, and the functionalist school of industrial design.  His unobtrusive approach and belief in "less, but better" (Weniger, aber besser) design has influenced the practice of design, as well as 20th century aesthetics and culture.  He is quoted as stating that "Indifference towards people and the reality in which they live is actually the one and only cardinal sin in design."
