  Over the last decade, Microsoft's revenue has more than doubled, driven by key product lines like its intelligent cloud infrastructure.

  Adding to this, Microsoft launched its AI-enabled search engine, Copilot last year, which has already generated $12 billion for the company. Beyond this search engine, Microsoft is developing a range of AI-based services, such as Azure Arc, a cloud computing platform with 18,000 customers.
