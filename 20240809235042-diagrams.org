#+begin_quote
  A diagram is a symbolic representation of information using visualization techniques.  Diagrams have been used since prehistoric times on walls of caves, but became more prevalent during the Enlightenment.  Sometimes, the technique uses a three-dimensional visualization which is then projected onto a two-dimensional surface.  The word graph is sometimes used as a synonym for diagram.
