  /*Introduction to Algorithms*/ is a book on computer programming by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_H._Cormen][Thomas H. Cormen]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_E._Leiserson][Charles E. Leiserson]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest][Ronald L. Rivest]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Stein][Clifford Stein]].  The book is described by its publisher as "the leading algorithms text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals".  It is commonly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation][cited]] as a reference for algorithms in published [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing#Scholarly_paper][papers]], with over 10,000 citations documented on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CiteSeerX][CiteSeerX]], and over 70,000 citations on Google Scholar as of 2024.  The book sold half a million copies during its first 20 years, and surpassed a million copies sold in 2022.  Its fame has led to the common use of the abbreviation "*CLRS*" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein), or, in the first edition, "*CLR*" (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest).

  In the preface, the authors write about how the book was written to be comprehensive and useful in both teaching and professional environments.  Each chapter focuses on an algorithm, and discusses its design techniques and areas of application.  Instead of using a specific programming language, the algorithms are written in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode][pseudocode]].  The descriptions focus on the aspects of the algorithm itself, its mathematical properties, and emphasize efficiency.
