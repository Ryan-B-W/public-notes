  * AMB

  This is an implementation of John McCarthy's ambiguous operator written in portable Common Lisp.

  The =amb= operator implements a system which is capable of automatically searching for a set of values for variables (henceforth called /ambiguous variables/) for which a set of constraints is satisfied.  The operator and its example use are described in detail in [[https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/4_002e3.xhtml#g_t4_002e3][Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs Chapter 4.3 (Nondeterministic Computing)]].

  See the [[https://github.com/phoe/amb/blob/main/doc/MANUAL.md][manual]] and the [[https://github.com/phoe/amb/blob/main/t/test-sicp.lisp][SICP test cases]] for examples.
