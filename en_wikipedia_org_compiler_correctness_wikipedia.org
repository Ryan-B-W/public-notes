  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing][computing]], *compiler correctness* is the branch of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science][computer science]] that deals with trying to show that a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler][compiler]] behaves according to its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language][language specification]].  Techniques include developing the compiler using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods][formal methods]] and using rigorous testing (often called compiler validation) on an existing compiler.
