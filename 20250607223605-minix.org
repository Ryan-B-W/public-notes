  ** What Is MINIX 3?

  MINIX 3 is a free, open-source, operating system designed to be highly reliable, flexible, and secure.  It is based on a tiny microkernel running in kernel mode with the rest of the operating system running as a number of isolated, protected, processes in user mode.  It runs on x86 and ARM CPUs, is compatible with NetBSD, and runs thousands of NetBSD packages.  Get MINIX 3 now and [[https://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=www:community:][join our community!]]
