  The Invisible Internet Project (*I2P*) is an anonymous network, similar to [[https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Tor][Tor]].  The key difference is that I2P is internal, focusing on providing anonymous services within the network rather than proxying traffic to the regular internet (although some proxy services do exist).
