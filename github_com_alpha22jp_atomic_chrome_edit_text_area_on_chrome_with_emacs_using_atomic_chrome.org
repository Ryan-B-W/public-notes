  * Atomic Chrome for Emacs

  This is the Emacs version of [[https://github.com/tuvistavie/atomic-chrome][Atomic Chrome]] which is an extension for Google Chrome browser that allows you to edit text areas of the browser in Emacs.  It's similar to [[https://github.com/stsquad/emacs_chrome][Edit with Emacs]], but has some advantages as below with the help of websocket.

  - The input on Emacs is reflected to the browser instantly and continuously.
  - You can use both the browser and Emacs at the same time.  They are updated to the same content bi-directionally.

  *Since v2.0.0, Atomic Chrome for Emacs supports [[https://github.com/GhostText/GhostText][Ghost Text]] as browser extension, bringing compatibility with Firefox, too.*
