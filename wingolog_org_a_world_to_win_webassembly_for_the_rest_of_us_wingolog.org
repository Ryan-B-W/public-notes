  ** a world to win: webassembly for the rest of us

  20 March 2023 9:06 AM

  Good day, comrades!

  Today I'd like to share the good news that WebAssembly is finally coming for the rest of us weirdos.

  : Igalia, S.L.

  This is a transcript-alike of a talk that I gave last week at [[https://bobkonf.de/2023/en/program.html][BOB 2023]], a gathering in Berlin of people that are using “technologies beyond the mainstream” to get things done: Haskell, Clojure, Elixir, and so on.  PDF slides [[https://wingolog.org/pub/2023-bobkonf-wasm-for-the-rest-of-us-slides.pdf][here]], and I'll link the video too when it becomes available.
