  In my previous post I looked back on one year of [[id:aca1324c-b142-4e34-a121-a8bb0a79ddf8][Emacs]] and it's occasional sluggishness, announcing I would try to move to [[id:54504d3e-4f52-4dd2-9f2a-3ad550400bc9][Neovim]] once more.  Today I want to give an update on how said attempted migration is coming along: it's pretty bad.  I would have preferred customizing my Neovim in lua, but gave up after about two hours of every single plugin being documented for setup in an init.vim file instead.  Don't even get me started with the possibility of using fennel (a [[id:84ae6e85-a6a2-4133-bc53-274238081c2d][lisp]] that compiles to lua) to configure it.  That would turn following documentation into a two step translation process.
