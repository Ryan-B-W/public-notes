  * Qwen2.5-32B

  **  Introduction

  Qwen2.5 is the latest series of Qwen large language models.  For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters.  Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2:

  - Significantly *more knowledge* and has greatly improved capabilities in *coding* and *mathematics*, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains.
  - Significant improvements in *instruction following*, *generating long texts* (over 8K tokens), *understanding structured data* (e.g, tables), and *generating structured outputs* especially JSON. *More resilient to the diversity of system prompts*, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.
  - *Long-context Support* up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens.
  - *Multilingual support* for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more.

  *This repo contains the base 32B Qwen2.5 model*, which has the following features:

  - Type: Causal Language Models
  - Training Stage: Pretraining
  - Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias
  - Number of Parameters: 32.5B
  - Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 31.0B
  - Number of Layers: 64
  - Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 40 for Q and 8 for KV
  - Context Length: 131,072 tokens

  *We do not recommend using base language models for conversations.* Instead, you can apply post-training, e.g., SFT, RLHF, continued pretraining, etc., on this model.

  For more details, please refer to our [[https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/][blog]], [[https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5][GitHub]], and [[https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Documentation]].

  **  Requirements

  The code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face =transformers= and we advise you to use the latest version of =transformers=.

  With =transformers<4.37.0=, you will encounter the following error:

  #+begin_example
  KeyError: 'qwen2'
  #+end_example

  **  Evaluation & Performance

  Detailed evaluation results are reported in this [[https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/][ðŸ“‘ blog]].

  For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [[https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/speed_benchmark.html][here]].
