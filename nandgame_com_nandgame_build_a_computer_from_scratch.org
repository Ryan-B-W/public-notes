  Welcome to *The Nand Game*!

  You are going to build a computer starting from basic components.

  The game consists of a series of levels.  In each level, you are tasked with building a component that behaves according to a specification.  This component can then be used as a building block in the next level.

  The game does not require any previous knowledge about computer architecture or software, and does not require math skills beyond addition and subtraction.  (It does require some patience---some of the tasks might take a while to solve!)

  Your first task is to build a *nand* component.

  On the left of the diagram is the exact specification of the task.  Click "Level Help" for further information which might be helpful.
