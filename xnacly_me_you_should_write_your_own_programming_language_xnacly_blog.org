  * You should write your own programming language

  I recently started writing an interpreted [[https://github.com/xNaCly/Sophia][programming language inspired by lisp]].  Mainly because its easy to parse the expressions :^).  I named it after my girlfriend and got started.  Its designed around single character operators, such as =.:+-*/^%=.

  After implementing the first few features I wanted to somewhat express the fun i had while writing this obscure language in this post while explaining why I think everyone should at least try to implement a subset of a programming language.  Even if the language is, like mine, a little bit esoteric.
