  Don't you miss the days when the web really was the world's greatest decentralized network?  Before everything got locked down into a handful of walled gardens?  So do we.

  Enter [[https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/][ActivityPub]]!  ActivityPub is a decentralized social networking protocol based on the [[https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/][ActivityStreams 2.0]] data format.  ActivityPub is an official W3C recommended standard published by the [[https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg][W3C Social Web Working Group]].  It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering notifications and subscribing to content.

  Sounds exciting?  Dive in!
