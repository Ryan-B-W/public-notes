It is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software][open-source]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_page_application][single page application]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki][wiki]] in the form of a single [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML][HTML]] file that includes [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets][CSS]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript][JavaScript]], embedded files such as images, and the text content.

  TiddlyWiki is an unusual example of a practical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)][quine]].  The idea of producing a copy of its own source code lies at the heart of TiddlyWiki's ability to independently save changes to itself.  /Quine/ is also the name of the unofficial TiddlyWiki application for iPhone/iPad.
