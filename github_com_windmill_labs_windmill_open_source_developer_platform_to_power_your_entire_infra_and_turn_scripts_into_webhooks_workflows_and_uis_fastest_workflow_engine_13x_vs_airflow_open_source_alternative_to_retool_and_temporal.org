#+filetags: :automation:software:website:

#+begin_quote
  Open-source developer infrastructure for internal tools (APIs, background jobs, workflows and UIs).  Self-hostable alternative to Retool, Pipedream, Superblocks and a simplified Temporal with autogenerated UIs and custom UIs to trigger workflows and scripts as internal apps.
  Scripts are turned into sharable UIs automatically, and can be composed together into flows or used into richer apps built with low-code.  Supported script languages supported are: Python, TypeScript, Go, Bash, SQL, and GraphQL.
