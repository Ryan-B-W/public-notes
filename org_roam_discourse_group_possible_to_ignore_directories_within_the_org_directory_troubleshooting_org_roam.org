  For this case, ~org-roam-file-exclude-regexp~, which is referenced by ~org-roam-file-p~, is probably a better option than ~org-roam-db-node-include-function~, which is referenced by ~org-roam-db-node-p~.  Itâ€™s missing from the manual at the moment.  Including the full path to the subdirectory in the regular expression should work:
  : (setq org-roam-file-exclude-regexp
  :       (concat "^" (expand-file-name org-roam-directory) "/exclude-this-subdir/")
