  [[https://www.youtube.com/@JakeBox0][Jake B]]

  In this video I show you how to export your org mode files to HTML files, easily viewable and sharable.  We'll go over basic options to adjust the export to your liking, and then take a look at custom CSS and setupfiles to make your exports beautiful.  Feel free to leave a comment with any questions, I try to reply to all of them!
