  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science][computer science]], a *lock* or *mutex* (from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion][mutual exclusion]]) is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_primitive][synchronization primitive]] that prevents state from being modified or accessed by multiple [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threads_(computer_science)][threads of execution]] at once.  Locks enforce mutual exclusion [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_control][concurrency control]] policies, and with a variety of possible methods there exist multiple unique implementations for different applications.
