  * display

  The *=display=* [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS][CSS]] property sets whether an element is treated as a [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Flow_layout][block or inline box]] and the layout used for its children, such as [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Flow_layout][flow layout]], [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout][grid]] or [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout][flex]].

  Formally, the *=display=* property sets an element's inner and outer /display types/.  The outer type sets an element's participation in [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Flow_layout][flow layout]]; the inner type sets the layout of children.  Some values of =display= are fully defined in their own individual specifications; for example the detail of what happens when =display: flex= is declared is defined in the CSS Flexible Box Model specification.
