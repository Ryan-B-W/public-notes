#+title: (peps.python.org) PEP 634 â€“ Structural Pattern Matching: Specification | peps.python.org
#+filetags: :website:

#+begin_quote
  This PEP provides the technical specification for the match statement.  It replaces [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0622/][PEP 622]], which is hereby split in three parts:

  - [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0634/][PEP 634]]: Specification
  - [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0635/][PEP 635]]: Motivation and Rationale
  - [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/][PEP 636]]: Tutorial

  This PEP is intentionally devoid of commentary; the motivation and all explanations of our design choices are in [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0635/][PEP 635]].  First-time readers are encouraged to start with [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/][PEP 636]], which provides a gentler introduction to the concepts, syntax and semantics of patterns.
