  One of my favorite books on programming is /Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs/ by Hal Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie Sussman.  This book is usually referred to by its initials (SICP, pronounced “sick pea”).  It's old; the first edition came out in 1984 and the second in 1996.  It's also one of the great classics of computer science.  (You can read it online in its entirety [[https://shorturl.at/swNW1][here]].)

  It's hard to summarize the book, because it covers so much ground, but here goes.
