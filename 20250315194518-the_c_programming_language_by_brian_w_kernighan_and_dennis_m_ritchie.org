  /*The C Programming Language*/ (sometimes termed /*K&R*/, after its authors' initials) is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming][computer programming]] book written by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan][Brian Kernighan]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie][Dennis Ritchie]], the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language][C programming language]], as well as co-designed the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix][Unix]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system][operating system]] with which development of the language was closely intertwined.  The book was central to the development and popularization of C and is still widely read and used today.  Because the book was co-authored by the original language designer, and because the first edition of the book served for many years as the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto][de facto]]/ standard for the language, the book was regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on C.
