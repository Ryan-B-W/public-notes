  * 2 INTRODUCTION

  ** 2.1 Hidpp10 vs Hidpp20

  Both protocols use the same transport. From a host SW perspective the API used to send/receive already crafted hidpp10 and hidpp20 messages should be the same.

  Hidpp20 enumeration process is described elsewhere. This document exposes a subset of the hidpp10 specification that targets the Logitech Unifying receiver. Among other things, device connect/disconnect, pairing/unpairing is covered by this document.

  The Logitech Unifying receiver carries the USB VID 046d and PID 0xc52b
