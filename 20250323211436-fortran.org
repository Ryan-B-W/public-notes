  *Fortran* ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English][/ˈfɔːrtræn/]]; formerly *FORTRAN*) is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-generation_programming_language][third-generation]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language][compiled]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming][imperative]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language][programming language]] that is especially suited to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis][numeric computation]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science][scientific computing]].

  Fortran was originally developed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM][IBM]].  It first compiled correctly in 1958.  Fortran [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program][computer programs]] have been written to support scientific and engineering applications, such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction][numerical weather prediction]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method][finite element analysis]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics][computational fluid dynamics]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)][plasma physics]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysics][geophysics]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_physics][computational physics]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallography][crystallography]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry][computational chemistry]].  It is a popular language for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing][high-performance computing]] and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500][fastest supercomputers]].

  Fortran has evolved through numerous versions and dialects.  In 1966, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute][American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) developed a standard for Fortran to limit proliferation of compilers using slightly different syntax.  Successive versions have added support for a character data type (Fortran 77), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming][structured programming]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming][array programming]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming][modular programming]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming][generic programming]] (Fortran 90), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Fortran][parallel computing]] ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran_95_language_features][Fortran 95]]), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming][object-oriented programming]] (Fortran 2003), and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_programming][concurrent programming]] (Fortran 2008).

  Since April 2024, Fortran has ranked among the top ten languages in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index][TIOBE index]], a measure of the popularity of programming languages.
