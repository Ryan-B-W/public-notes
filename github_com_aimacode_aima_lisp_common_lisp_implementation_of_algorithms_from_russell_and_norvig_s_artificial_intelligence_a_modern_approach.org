  Common Lisp implementation of algorithms from Russell And Norvig's book /Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach./

  This repository was the original code base, back in 1995.  Since then, the Java and Python versions have become more popular, and this Lisp version is no longer up-to-date.  But it is here for whatever use you want to make of it.
