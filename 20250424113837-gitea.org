  * Gitea

  [[https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/main/README.zh-tw.md][繁體中文]] | [[https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/main/README.zh-cn.md][简体中文]]

  ** Purpose

  The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.

  As Gitea is written in Go, it works across *all* the platforms and architectures that are supported by Go, including Linux, macOS, and Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures.  This project has been [[https://blog.gitea.com/welcome-to-gitea/][forked]] from [[https://gogs.io/][Gogs]] since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.

  For online demonstrations, you can visit [[https://demo.gitea.com/][demo.gitea.com]].

  For accessing free Gitea service (with a limited number of repositories), you can visit [[https://gitea.com/user/login][gitea.com]].

  To quickly deploy your own dedicated Gitea instance on Gitea Cloud, you can start a free trial at [[https://cloud.gitea.com/][cloud.gitea.com]].
