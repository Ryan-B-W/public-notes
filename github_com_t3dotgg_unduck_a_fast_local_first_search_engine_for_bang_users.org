  * Unduck

  DuckDuckGo's bang redirects are too slow.  Add the following URL as a custom search engine to your browser.  Enables all of DuckDuckGo's bangs to work, but much faster.

  https://unduck.link?q=%s

  ** How is it that much faster?

  DuckDuckGo does their redirects server side.  Their DNS is...not always great.  Result is that it often takes ages.

  I solved this by doing all of the work client side.  Once you've went to [[https://unduck.link/][https://unduck.link]] once, the JS is all cache'd and will never need to be downloaded again.  Your device does the redirects, not me.
