  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory][programming language theory]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory][proof theory]], the *Curry–Howard correspondence* is the direct relationship between [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program][computer programs]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof][mathematical proofs]].  It is also known as the *Curry–Howard isomorphism* or *equivalence*, or the *proofs-as-programs* and *propositions-* or *formulae-as-types interpretation*.

  It is a generalization of a syntactic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy][analogy]] between systems of formal logic and computational calculi that was first discovered by the American [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician][mathematician]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry][Haskell Curry]] and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logician][logician]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Alvin_Howard][William Alvin Howard]].  It is the link between logic and computation that is usually attributed to Curry and Howard, although the idea is related to the operational interpretation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic][intuitionistic logic]] given in various formulations by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._E._J._Brouwer][L. E. J. Brouwer]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arend_Heyting][Arend Heyting]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov][Andrey Kolmogorov]] (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov_interpretation][Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]]) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Kleene][Stephen Kleene]] (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realizability][Realizability]]).  The relationship has been extended to include [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory][category theory]] as the three-way *Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence*.
