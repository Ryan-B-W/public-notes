  * Constraints

  info

  This page documents the new JavaScript-based constraints.  The older constraints, based on Prolog, are still supported but should be considered deprecated.  Their documentation can be found [[https://v3.yarnpkg.com/features/constraints][here]].

  ** Overview

  Constraints allow enforcement of rules across [[https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces][workspace]] packages.  For example, these rules might include the following:

  - Ensuring the same version of dependencies across packages.
  - Prohibiting the use of specific dependencies in packages.
