A CRDT is a type of [[id:06a2cb83-466e-4e40-ac36-6dd7110d9535][data-structure]] used in distributed systems where the data-structure is replicated across the distributed system.  A CRDT satisfies the following criteria:
 - Each replica can be updated independently, concurrently, and without conflict or coordination with other replicas
 - Any inconsistencies that occur are automatically resolved by an algorithm that is part of the data-structure
 - The replicas in the CRDT eventually achieve consistency
