  This question attempts to collect the few pearls among the dozens of bad C++ books that are published every year.

  Unlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go from tutorials found on the Internet, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book.  It is way too big and complex for doing this.  In fact, it is so big and complex, that /*there are very many very bad C++ books*/ out there.  And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting /glaringly obvious factual errors/ and /promoting abysmally bad programming styles/.

  Please edit the accepted answer to provide *quality books* and an approximate skill level --- /preferably/ *after* /discussing your addition in [[https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/10/loungec][the C++ chat room]]/. (The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from.  Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc.  Books that meet the criteria will be added to the list.  Books that have reviews by the Association of C and C++ Users (ACCU) have links to the review.

This is largely because it does not attempt to be an introduction to /programming/, but an introduction to /C++/ for people who've previously programmed in some other language.  It has a steeper learning curve, but, for those who can cope with this, it is a very compact introduction to the language. (Historically, it broke new ground by being the first beginner's book to use a modern approach to teaching the language.) Despite this, the C++ it teaches is purely C++98. | [[https://accu.org/bookreviews/2000/glassborow_1185][[Review]]] |

  - [[https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201548550][/Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms/]] (James Coplien) A predecessor of the pattern movement, it describes many C++-specific “idioms”.  It's certainly a very good book and might still be worth a read if you can spare the time, but quite old and not up-to-date with current C++.

  - [[https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201633620][/Large Scale C++ Software Design/]] (John Lakos) Lakos explains techniques to manage very big C++ software projects.  Certainly, a good read, if it only was up to date.  It was written long before C++ 98 and misses on many features (e.g. namespaces) important for large-scale projects.  If you need to work on a big C++ software project, you might want to read it, although you need to take more than a grain of salt with it.  Not to be confused with the extended and later book series Large Scale C++ volume I-III.

  - [[https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201834545][/Inside the C++ Object Model/]] (Stanley Lippman) If you want to know how virtual member functions are commonly implemented and how base objects are commonly laid out in memory in a multi-inheritance scenario, and how all this affects performance, this is where you will find thorough discussions of such topics.

  - [[https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201514591][/The Annotated C++ Reference Manual/]] (Bjarne Stroustrup, Margaret A. Ellis) This book is quite outdated in the fact that it explores the 1989 C++ 2.0 version - Templates, exceptions, namespaces, and new casts were not yet introduced.  Saying that however, this book goes through the entire C++ standard of the time explaining the rationale, the possible implementations, and features of the language.  This is not a book to learn programming principles and patterns on C++, but to understand every aspect of the C++ language.

  - [[https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0139798099][/Thinking in C++/]] (Bruce Eckel, 2nd Edition, 2000).  Two volumes; is a tutorial-style /free/ set of intro-level books.  Downloads: [[https://ia800100.us.archive.org/10/items/TICPP2ndEdVolOne/TICPP-2nd-ed-Vol-one.zip][vol 1]], [[https://ia800108.us.archive.org/24/items/TICPP2ndEdVolTwo/TICPP-2nd-ed-Vol-two.zip][vol 2]].  Unfortunately, they're marred by a number of trivial errors (e.g. maintaining that temporaries are automatic =const=), with no official errata list.  A partial 3^{rd} party errata list is available at [[http://www.computersciencelab.com/Eckel.htm]], but it is apparently not maintained.

  - [[https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201533936][/Scientific and Engineering C++: An Introduction to Advanced Techniques and Examples/]] (John Barton and Lee Nackman) It is a comprehensive and very detailed book that tried to explain and make use of all the features available in C++, in the context of numerical methods.  It introduced at the time several new techniques, such as the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP, also called Barton-Nackman trick).  It pioneered several techniques such as dimensional analysis and automatic differentiation.  It came with a lot of compilable and useful code, ranging from an expression parser to a Lapack wrapper.  The code is [[https://www.informit.com/store/scientific-and-engineering-c-plus-plus-an-introduction-9780201533934][still available online]].  Unfortunately, the books have become somewhat outdated in style and C++ features, however, it was an incredible tour-de-force at the time (1994, pre-STL).  The chapters on dynamics inheritance are a bit complicated to understand and not very useful.  An updated version of this classic book that includes move semantics and the lessons learned from the STL would be very nice.
