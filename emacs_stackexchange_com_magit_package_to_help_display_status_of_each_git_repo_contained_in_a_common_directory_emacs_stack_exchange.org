  dired-k and dired-git-info show information about files within a repository in Dired.  Not what you asked for but you might find these packages useful anyway.
  If your repositories are actually submodules of an outer repository, then these packages should show information about the repositories themselves too.  If not, then I would consider that a bug.
  Magit provides some support for showing information about a list of repositories, but it doesn't use the Dired interface to do so.  See List Repositories.
