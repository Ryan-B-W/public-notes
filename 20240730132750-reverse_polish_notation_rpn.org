#+title: Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)
#+filetags: :mathematics:programming:computer_science:

An alternative to the more common infix notation used for mathematics.  Instead of operands surrounding operators, it has all operands come before the relevant operator.  Has the benefit of not needing parenthesis to control operator order in compound expressions.  Furthermore, can be easily implemented via a stack with extremely simple parsing.  It is also a relatively convenient way to input calculations to a calculator when one is used to it.
