  U.S. Marines M1A1 tank crews work with the Norwegian Telemark Battalion on techniques of driving tracked vehicles in winter conditions on an snow/ice track.

  A Norwegian Leopard 2 Main Battle Tank leads U.S. Marine M1 Abrams, from the Combined Arms Company, to various cold-weather training sites for tracked vehicles in Rena, Norway.

  The training exercise is designed to improve U.S. Marine Corps capability to operate in cold-weather environments.
