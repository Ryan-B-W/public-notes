  /“More is not better (or worse) than less, just different.”/
  --- The paradigm paradox.

  /“Wonderful book, very insightful, strangely easy to read (haven't figured that out yet), very unusual in many respects.”/
  --- Doug Merritt.

  /“The overarching achievement of this book is to be so provocative that one wants to engage the authors in debate about almost everything they say.  Partly this is due to the chirpy writing style [...] but mostly it is their delicious iconoclasm.”/
  --- Peter Gammie, Book Review, Journal of Functional Programming, March 2009.
