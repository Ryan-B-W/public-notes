  * Awesome Common Lisp

  A curated list of /awesome/ Common Lisp libraries.

  For awesome /software/, see [[http://lisp-lang.org/success/][lisp-lang.org's success stories]] and the [[https://github.com/azzamsa/awesome-cl-software][awesome-cl-software]] list.

  All libraries listed here are available from [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]] unless stated otherwise.  The ones marked with a ‚≠ê are so widespread and solid that they became community standards.  You can't be wrong with them.  This is the case for Quicklisp, BordeauxThreads and such.  Libraries denoted with a üëç are the ones we like and want to promote here at the Awesome-cl list.  They proved solid, they may solve a problem better than a community standard but they aren't as widespread, or not considered as stable.  For example, we prefer Spinneret over Cl-Who.

  Add something new!  See the [[https://awesome-cl.com/#contributing][contributing]] section for adding something to the list.
