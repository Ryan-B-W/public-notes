  Posted on August 15th, 2016.

  The [[https://itch.io/jam/august-2016-lisp-game-jam][August 2016 Lisp Game Jam]] just wrapped up at the end of last week.  I had some free time so I decided to take part, but I did something a bit different.  Instead of making a new game I ported an existing one ([[http://bitbucket.org/sjl/silt/][Silt]]) to Common Lisp.

  I once read somewhere that when trying to build things and learn programming languages you should either build something you know in a language you're learning, or build something new in a language you already know, but /not/ try to do both at the same time.  I've been getting into Common Lisp over the past year, so for this game jam I decided to port my [[https://stevelosh.com/blog/2015/12/ludum-dare-34/][Ludum Dare 34 game]] from Clojure to Common Lisp.

  The game jam was ten days long.  I didn't work on the game every day, but I did manage to finish porting it over.  I improved and polished a few mechanics along the way, learned a lot, and ended up with a nice little library that sprung out of the code.  I'm happy with the result.

  The code is [[http://bitbucket.org/sjl/silt2/][on Bitbucket]].  You can play the game over telnet if you want to try it out: =telnet silt.stevelosh.com=.  In this post I'm just going to jot down a few things I found interesting.

  Disclaimer: I'm going to simplify some of the code snippets to make them easier to read.  If you want the full details you can read the actual code.
