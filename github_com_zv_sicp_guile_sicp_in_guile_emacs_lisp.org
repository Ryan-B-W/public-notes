  /Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs/ (SICP) is a computing textbook by [[http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/mac/][Hal Abelson]] & [[http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/][Gerald Sussman]], published by MIT in two editions (1985, 1995) and noted for it's ambitious approach to instruction in the logic of computer programming.
