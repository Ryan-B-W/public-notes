The first [[id:a0ac6689-ad9b-4a28-b630-0dd12f15cff1][hypertext]] project, started in 1960 by [[id:33d5bcba-4e40-45e8-9c15-282f356046d5][Ted Nelson]].  The most well-known fully fleshed-out conceptualization of hypertext and a competitor to the [[id:05f2a17c-4ceb-42fa-bcc8-16d61473804b][World Wide Web]].

  *Project Xanadu* ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English][/ˈzænəduː/]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key][/ZAN-ə-doo/]]) was the first [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext][hypertext]] project, founded in 1960 by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson][Ted Nelson]].  Administrators of Project Xanadu have declared it superior to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web][World Wide Web]], with the mission statement: "Today's popular software simulates paper.  The World Wide Web (another imitation of paper) trivialises our original hypertext model with one-way ever-breaking links and no management of version or contents."

  /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)][Wired]]/ magazine published an article entitled "The Curse of Xanadu", calling Project Xanadu "the longest-running [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware][vaporware]] story in the history of the computer industry".  The first attempt at implementation began in 1960, but it was not until 1998 that an incomplete implementation was released.  A version described as "a working [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverable][deliverable]]", *OpenXanadu*, was made available in 2014.
