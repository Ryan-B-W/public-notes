  [[http://www.bildelarstore.se/science/c-programming-language-4-edition/][Romainian translation of this page]].

  See also [[https://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html][C++11 FAQ]] and [[https://www.stroustrup.com/3rd.html][The C++ Programming Language (Special Edition)]].

  Available here:

  - [[https://www.stroustrup.com/4thPreface.pdf][The Preface]]
  - [[https://www.stroustrup.com/4thContents.html][Extended Table of Contents]].  Not in printed version.  I didn't think it was worth an extra 1000 lines.  Each chapter starts with its own table of contents.
  - [[https://www.stroustrup.com/4thExercises.pdf][Exercises]].  Not in printed version.  I did not want to add another 80 pages to the book and I want to be able to add and change exercises over the years.  The collection of exercises should be complete (if minimal) ASAP.
  - Concept code.  I have so far failed to get my ``taylor made'' and stable version ready for posting, but see Andrew Sutton's [[http://code.google.com/p/origin/][Origin library]] on which the book's concepts are based.

  If you are looking for a shorter and less complete introduction to C++, consider: Bjarne Stroustrup: [[https://www.stroustrup.com/tour3.html][A Tour of C++ (3rd Edition)]].  The ``tour'' is a quick (about 240 pages) tutorial overview of all of standard C++ at a moderately high level for people who already know C++ or at least are experienced programmers.

  If you are looking for an an introduction to programming for people who has never programmed before, consider [[https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html][Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++]].  That book is also be useful for people who have programmed a bit and want to improve their style and technique - or to simply learn modern C++.  It is designed for classroom use, but written with an eye on self study.

  ** Errata

  Feel free to send me suggested errata.  I will fix every mistake that can be fixed within the constrains of the book.  I will post every errata that I think might impede understanding(eventually; I'm unfortunately way behind the printed books).

  - [[https://www.stroustrup.com/4th_printing3.html][For the 3rd printing]]

  People have pointed out that the {} doesn't work for copy construction:

  : X x1 {2};      // construct from integer (assume suitable constructor)
  : X x2 {x1};      // copy construction: fails on GCC 4.8 and Clang 3.2

  I know that.  It's a bug in the standard.  Fixed for C++14.  For now use one of the traditional notations:

  : X x3(x1);      // copy construction
  : X x4 = x1;      // copy construction

  Thanks to all who send me problems, correction, and clarifications: Ron Avitzur, Matt Austern, Charles A. Barr, Paul Bennett, Thaddeus Black, Andreas Boerner, Keith Boruff, A.

  Apologies if I missed a name.

  Some might find it reassuring that many (most?) problems were spotted by several people.

  ** Reviews

  I don't have to agree with a review or blog post to list it, but it helps if I think at least some parts make sense.
