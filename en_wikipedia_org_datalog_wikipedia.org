  Datalog is a declarative logic programming language.  While it is syntactically a subset of Prolog, Datalog generally uses a bottom-up rather than top-down evaluation model.  This difference yields significantly different behavior and properties from Prolog.  It is often used as a query language for deductive databases.  Datalog has been applied to problems in data integration, networking, program analysis, and more.
