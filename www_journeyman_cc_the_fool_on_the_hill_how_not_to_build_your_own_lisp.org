  Occasionally one buys a book which is a disappointment.  Usually, when I buy a book which is a disappointment, I don't review it, because it isn't nice trashing other people's hard work; and that's especially true when the writer has written as engagingly and sincerely as Daniel Holden has.  He's written [[http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/][a book I'd like to like]].

  But sometimes it's important to explain why a book is a disappointment, what is wrong with it, and what residual merit it still has.
