  Xah Fly Keys is more efficient than vim, or any keybinding set in history.
  xah-fly-keys.el is a modal editing mode for emacs, like vi, but the design of key/command choice is based on command frequency statistics and ease-of-key score.  Most frequently used commands have most easy keys.
  If you have hand pain from using emacs, consider using Xah Fly Keys.  Never need to press Ctrl+x and never need to press Meta anymore.

  A modal keybinding for emacs (like vim), but based on command frequency and ergonomics.
  This is the most efficient editing system in the universe.
