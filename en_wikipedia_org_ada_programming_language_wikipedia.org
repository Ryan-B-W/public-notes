  *Ada* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming][structured]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statically_typed][statically typed]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming][imperative]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming][object-oriented]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language][high-level programming language]], inspired by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)][Pascal]] and other languages.  It has built-in language support for /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract][design by contract]]/ (DbC), extremely [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing][strong typing]], explicit concurrency, tasks, synchronous [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing][message passing]], protected [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)][objects]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_programming][non-determinism]].  Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler][compiler]] to find errors in favor of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_(program_lifecycle_phase)][runtime]] errors.  Ada is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard][international]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard][technical standard]], jointly defined by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization][International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission][International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC).  As of May 2023, the standard, ISO/IEC 8652:2023, is called Ada 2022 informally.

  Ada was originally designed by a team led by French [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist][computer scientist]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Ichbiah][Jean Ichbiah]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupe_Bull][Honeywell]] under contract to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense][United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) from 1977 to 1983 to supersede over 450 programming languages then used by the DoD.  Ada was named after [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace][Ada Lovelace]] (1815--1852), who has been credited as the first computer programmer.
