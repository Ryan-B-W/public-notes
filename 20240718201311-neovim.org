A fork of [[id:37c53f5b-c586-41ff-a4fe-b44c05ed3c1f][Vim]] that aims to extend Vim with built-in LSP support, Lua for scripting, and, later, built-in tree-sitter support.  Commonly used with advanced configurations and package managers as an IDE.  Current-day competitor to [[id:aca1324c-b142-4e34-a121-a8bb0a79ddf8][Emacs]].
