#+title: (github.com) mifi/editly: Slick, declarative command line video editing & API
#+filetags: :video_editing:graphics:open_source:software:website:

#+begin_quote
  *Editly* is a tool and framework for declarative NLE (*non-linear video editing*) using Node.js and ffmpeg.  Editly allows you to easily and *programmatically create a video* from a *set of clips, images, audio and titles*, with smooth transitions and music overlaid.

  Editly has a simple CLI for quickly assembling a video from a set of clips or images, or you can use its more flexible JavaScript API.

  Inspired by [[https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/ffmpeg-concat][ffmpeg-concat]], editly is much faster and doesn't require much storage because it uses *streaming* editing.  Editly aims to be very extensible and feature rich with a pluggable interface for adding new *dynamic content*.
