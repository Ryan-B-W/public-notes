Project to bootstrap compiler toolchains from human-auditable sources.

  Do you know how to make yoghurt? The first step is to add yoghurt to milk! How can you build a compiler like [[id:c40f8163-bc08-4dcc-b9b6-b53ee8f6ef02][GCC]]? The first step is to get a compiler that can compile the compiler.
  Compilers are often written in the language they are compiling.  This creates a chicken-and-egg problem that leads users and distributors to rely on opaque, pre-built binaries of those compilers that they use to build newer versions of the compiler.
  To gain trust in our computing platforms, we need to be able to tell how each part was produced from source.  We believe that opaque binaries are a threat to user security and user freedom since they are not auditable; our goal is to minimize the amount of bootstrap binaries.
