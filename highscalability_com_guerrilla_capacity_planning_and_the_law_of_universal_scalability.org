#+begin_quote
  In the era of Web 2.0 traditional approaches to capacity planning are often difficult to implement.  Guerrilla Capacity Planning facilitates rapid forecasting of capacity requirements based on the opportunistic use of whatever performance data and tools are available.
  One unique Guerrilla tool is Virtual Load Testing, based on Dr. Gunther's "Universal Law of Computational Scaling", which provides a highly cost-effective method for assessing application scalability.  Neil Gunther, M.Sc., Ph.D. is an internationally recognized [[id:bf5900d9-5be8-49ca-bfcc-46587cc787dc][computer]] system performance consultant who founded Performance Dynamics Company in 1994.
