  * Git shouldn't be so hard to learn.

  When you're just getting started, something as straightforward as a merge can be terrifying.  It can take a long time to really become comfortable using some of Git's more advanced features.  /(It took me a year or two.)/

  Once people achieve some level of *Git enlightenment,* they tend to make statements of the form 'Git gets a lot easier once you realize X' -- but that doesn't do much for people staring up Git's steep learning curve.

  My goal with this site is to help you, Dear Reader, *understand what those smug bastards are talking about*.
