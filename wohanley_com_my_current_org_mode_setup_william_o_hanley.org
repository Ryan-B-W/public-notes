  * My current org-mode setup

  28 November 2022 William O'Hanley

  I've put some work into my org-mode setup in Emacs over the last while, and I've recently gotten pretty content with a setup with the following affordances:

  - Low-friction, non-hierarchical note-taking with =org-roam=
  - Plain-text annotation, interlinked with my other notes, of Zotero-managed reference material
  - An =org-agenda= that pulls events and TODOs from a wide variety of sources, including my notes
  - A flexible inbox that captures anything I can't deal with immediately, especially emails and web pages
  - Reminders for scheduled events and task deadlines

  It looks like this:

  Yes, I do actually use the graph.  It's hard to get it into a web page, but you can browse the underlying notes [[https://notes.wohanley.com/about][here]].

  I was thinking it would be nice to document it in case it's useful to anyone attempting something similar, so here we go.  All the configuration I reference here can be found in my [[https://gitlab.com/whohanley/dotfiles/-/tree/master/emacs][dotfiles repo]].
