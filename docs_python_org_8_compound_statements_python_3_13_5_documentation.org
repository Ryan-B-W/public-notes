  * 8. Compound statements

  Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way.  In general, compound statements span multiple lines, although in simple incarnations a whole compound statement may be contained in one line.

  ** 8.6. The =match= statement

  Added in version 3.10.

  The match statement is used for pattern matching.  Syntax:

  #+begin_example
  match_stmt   ::= 'match' subject_expr ":" NEWLINE INDENT case_block+ DEDENT
  subject_expr ::= star_named_expression "," star_named_expressions?
                   | named_expression
  case_block   ::= 'case' patterns [guard] ":" block
  #+end_example

  Note

  This section uses single quotes to denote [[https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#soft-keywords][soft keywords]].

  Pattern matching takes a pattern as input (following =case=) and a subject value (following =match=).  The pattern (which may contain subpatterns) is matched against the subject value.  The outcomes are:

  - A match success or failure (also termed a pattern success or failure).

  - Possible binding of matched values to a name.  The prerequisites for this are further discussed below.

  The =match= and =case= keywords are [[https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#soft-keywords][soft keywords]].
