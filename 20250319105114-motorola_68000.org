  The *Motorola 68000 series* (also known as *680x0*, *m68000*, *m68k*, or *68k*) is a family of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit_computing][32-bit]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer][complex instruction set computer]] (CISC) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor][microprocessors]].  During the 1980s and early 1990s, they were popular in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer][personal computers]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation][workstations]] and were the primary competitors of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel][Intel]]'s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86][x86]] microprocessors.  They were best known as the processors used in the early Apple [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)][Macintosh]], the Sharp [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X68000][X68000]], the Commodore [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga][Amiga]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL][Sinclair QL]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST][Atari ST]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Falcon][Falcon]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Jaguar][Atari Jaguar]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis][Sega Genesis]] (Mega Drive) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_CD][Sega CD]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips_CD-i][Philips CD-i]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_System][Capcom System I]] (Arcade), the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_UNIX_PC][AT&T UNIX PC]], the Tandy [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Model_II#Model_16B_and_Tandy_6000][Model 16/16B/6000]], the Sun Microsystems [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-1][Sun-1]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-2][Sun-2]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-3][Sun-3]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT_Computer][NeXT Computer]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTcube][NeXTcube]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTstation][NeXTstation]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTcube_Turbo][NeXTcube Turbo]], early [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Graphics][Silicon Graphics]] IRIS workstations, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthedes][Aesthedes]], computers from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASSCOMP][MASSCOMP]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments][Texas Instruments]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89][TI-89]]/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-92][TI-92]] calculators, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Pilot][Palm Pilot]] (all models running Palm OS 4.x or earlier), the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Data_Corporation][Control Data Corporation]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=CDCNET&action=edit&redlink=1][CDCNET]] Device Interface, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTech][VTech]] Precomputer Unlimited and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle][Space Shuttle]].  Although no modern desktop computers are based on processors in the 680x0 series, derivative processors are still widely used in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system][embedded systems]].

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola][Motorola]] ceased development of the 680x0 series architecture in 1994, replacing it with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC][PowerPC]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC][RISC]] architecture, which was developed in conjunction with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM][IBM]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer][Apple Computer]] as part of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_alliance][AIM alliance]].
