  * How I org in 2023

  2023-03-25

  I've been pretty much living in =org-mode= for 6 or 7 years now.  It's my exocortex, second brain, second mind, mind palace, pensive, and personal knowledge management system.  The features and tools I use as well as how I organize my files has changed quite a bit over this period of time and I thought it would be nice give myself (and anyone else who cares) a reference of what it was like in 2023 so here it is.
