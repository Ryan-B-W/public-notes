  * Hoot: Scheme on WebAssembly

  [[https://files.spritely.institute/images/blog/hoot.png]]

  Hoot is a Spritely project for running Scheme code on Wasm GC-capable web browsers, featuring a Scheme to Wasm compiler and a full-featured Wasm toolchain.

  Hoot is built on [[https://gnu.org/software/guile][Guile]] and has no additional dependencies.  The toolchain is self-contained and even features a Wasm interpreter for testing Hoot binaries without leaving the Guile REPL.
