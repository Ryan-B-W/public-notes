  * CLM

  Common Lisp Music is a music synthesis and signal processing package in the Music V family.  It runs in a number of lisps or as a part of Snd (using Scheme or Ruby).  The file README.clm has current status info for the Common Lisp versions.  The mailing list for clm news is cmdist@ccrma.stanford.edu.  Common Music, CMN, and the Snd editor also use this list.
