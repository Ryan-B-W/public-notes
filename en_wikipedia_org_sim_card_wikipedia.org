  A *SIM card* or *SIM* (Subscriber Identity Module) is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit][integrated circuit]] (IC) intended to securely store an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity][international mobile subscriber identity]] (IMSI) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_telephone][mobile telephone]] devices (such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone][mobile phones]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop][laptops]]).  SIMs are also able to store [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_book][address book]] contacts information, and may be protected using a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identification_number][PIN code]] to prevent unauthorized use.

  SIMs are always used on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM][GSM]] phones; for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-division_multiple_access][CDMA]] phones, they are needed only for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)][LTE]]-capable handsets.  SIM cards are also used in various [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_phone][satellite phones]], smart watches, computers, or cameras.  The first SIM cards were the size of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_card][credit and bank cards]]; sizes were reduced several times over the years, usually keeping electrical contacts the same, to fit smaller-sized devices.  SIMs are transferable between different mobile devices by removing the card itself.

  Technically, the actual physical card is known as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_integrated_circuit_card][universal integrated circuit card]] (UICC); this [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card][smart card]] is usually made of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride][PVC]] with embedded contacts and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor][semiconductors]], with the SIM as its primary component.  In practice the term "SIM card" is still used to refer to the entire unit and not simply the IC.  A SIM contains a unique serial number, integrated circuit card identification (ICCID), international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number, security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to, and four passwords: a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identification_number][personal identification number]] (PIN) for ordinary use, and a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_unblocking_key][personal unblocking key]] (PUK) for PIN unlocking as well as a second pair (called PIN2 and PUK2 respectively) which are used for managing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_Dialing_Number][fixed dialing number]] and some other functionality.  In Europe, the serial SIM number (SSN) is also sometimes accompanied by an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number][international article number]] (IAN) or a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number][European article number]] (EAN) required when registering online for the subscription of a prepaid card.

  As of 2020, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESIM][eSIM]] is superseding physical SIM cards in some domains, including cellular telephony.  eSIM uses a software-based SIM embedded into an irremovable [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUICC][eUICC]].
