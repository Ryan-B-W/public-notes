  * Teach Yourself Computer Science

  Note: this guide was extensively updated in May 2020.  For the prior version, [[https://teachyourselfcs.com/2016/][see here]].

  If you're a self-taught engineer or bootcamp grad, you owe it to yourself to learn computer science.  Thankfully, you can give yourself a world-class CS education without investing years and a small fortune in a degree program üí∏.

  There are plenty of resources out there, but some are better than others.  You don't need yet another ‚Äú200+ Free Online Courses‚Äù listicle.  You need answers to these questions:

  - *Which subjects* should you learn, and why?
  - What is the *best book or video lecture series* for each subject?

  This guide is our attempt to definitively answer these questions.
