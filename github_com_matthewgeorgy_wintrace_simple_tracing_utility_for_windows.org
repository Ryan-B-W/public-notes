  * wintrace

  =wintrace= is a simple tracing utility for Windows programs.  It's essentially an =strace=/=ltrace= equivalent like on Linux, but for Windows.

  It currently supports a wide range of Win32 functions, as well as some functions from the CRT.  See below for a complete list of supported functions (COMING SOON...).
