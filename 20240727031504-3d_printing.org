#+title: 3D Printing/Additive Manufacturing
#+filetags: :3d_printing:manufacturing:

A manufacturing technology more specifically and technically referred to as additive manufacturing.

Common forms include:
* Fused Deposition Modeling™ (FDM)/Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4852bbc5-c5bf-4339-9604-8e2296b888a6
:END:
A manufacturing method that typically uses a plastic filament and a hotend to melt said filament to build up parts layer by layer.  The most common form of 3D printing with plastic.
* Stereolithography (SLA) Printing

:END:
Another popular form of 3D printing that uses UV curable resin and a UV laser with mirror galvanometers to cure single layers of the resin on a build plate and build up the part from the clear bottom of a tank.  The parts need to be cleaned and cured after printing to fully cure the partially cured resin.

* Masked-Stereolithography (MSLA)
Very similar to [[id:83b2992d-eadb-41d7-8c0a-e1f0b3fcb44d][SLA]] except that it uses a photo-mask, typically an LCD panel, to mask a UV lamp to cure a whole layer of resin at once instead of scanning with a UV laser.  In recent years, more popular than classic SLA since it is much faster.
* Powder Bed Fusion (DMLS, SLS, SLM, MJF, & EBM)
