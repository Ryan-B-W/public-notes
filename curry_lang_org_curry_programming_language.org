  * Curry

  A Truly Integrated Functional Logic Programming Language

  #+begin_src curry
    -- Returns the last number of a list.
    last :: [Int] -> Int
    last (_ ++ [x]) = x

    -- Returns some permutation of a list.
    perm :: [a] -> [a]
    perm []     = []
    perm (x:xs) = insert (perm xs)
     where insert ys     = x : ys
           insert (y:ys) = y : insert ys
  #+end_src

  Curry is a declarative multi-paradigm programming language which combines in a seamless way features from functional programming (nested expressions, higher-order functions, strong typing, lazy evaluation) and logic programming (non-determinism, built-in search, free variables, partial data structures).  Compared to the single programming paradigms, Curry provides additional features, like optimal evaluation for logic-oriented computations and flexible, non-deterministic pattern matching with user-defined functions.
