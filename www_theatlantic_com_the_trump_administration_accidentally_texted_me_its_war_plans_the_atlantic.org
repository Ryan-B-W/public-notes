  * The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans

  U.S. national-security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes in Yemen.  I didn't think it could be real.  Then the bombs started falling.

  The world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen.

  I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming.  The reason I knew this is that [[https://www.theatlantic.com/tag/person/pete-hegseth/][Pete Hegseth]], the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m.  The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.
