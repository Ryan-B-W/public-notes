  * Maintaining this Wiki

  All you need to know about how to create and maintain Wiki pages.

  This wiki is generated by [[https://getzola.org/][Zola]] using source files from [[https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/wiki][AOSC-Dev/wiki]] on GitHub.  If you wish to contribute, you can add or modify articles inside =contents= folder of the repository, then create a pull request (or directly push to the repository, if you're already a developer of the community).  Before pushing, you can verify your work by running =zola serve= on your computer and take a look at how the wiki will look like after your modification.
