  Babel has special support for embedding your Emacs initialization into Org files.  The org-babel-load-file function can be used to load the Emacs Lisp code blocks embedded in a literate Org file in the same way that you might load a regular Emacs Lisp file, such as .emacs.
  This allows you to make use of Org features, such as folding, tags, notes, HTML export, etc., to organize and maintain your Emacs initialization.
