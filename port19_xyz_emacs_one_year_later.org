  On the 7th of January 2022 I decided to install Doom Emacs.  I toyed with the basics that night and continued to do so the next day.  After two months, I wrote a first blog post on it.  That being the oldest post hosted on this site today (check it out).  I stayed on [[id:aca1324c-b142-4e34-a121-a8bb0a79ddf8][Emacs]] for a while, switched back to Neovim for a few months and then came back again.  I even wrote my first scientific paper in some org-latex hybrid.  [[id:5ab4a0b0-95e2-40cf-b924-709db3115d48][Orgmode]], not Emacs, has given me great power which comes with great responsibility that I'm getting tired off.
