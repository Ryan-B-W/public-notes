  * Use your text editor in the browser

  Whenever you're writing more than a little snippet of code anywhere on the web, activate GhostText to open your preferred text editor and enjoy your own development environment.

  ** Installation

  GhostText is a browser extension that connects to your editor via its own extension.  Install both extensions and, if necessary, start the GhostText server in the editor's extension.

  *** Choose your browser

  *** Choose your text editor

  Most editor extensions are authored by third parties.  You can create more extensions for your favorite editor!  Refer to [[https://github.com/fregante/GhostText/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md][the protocol document]].

  ** Usage

  Once you have installed both browser and editor extensions, you can activate GhostText in the current browser tab by clicking its icon in the toolbar or by using a [[https://ghosttext.fregante.com/#keyboard-shortcuts][keyboard shortcut]].  The editor needs to be launched first.

  Notice: in some editors you'll need to run the /Enable GhostText/ command to start the server.  Refer to the documentation of each extension.  Sublime Text doesn't need this step.

  ** How it works

  GhostText is split in two parts:

  1. A HTTP and WebSocket server in the text editor
  2. A client in the browser

  When you activate GhostText, the browser will try contacting the server in the text editor (at the port specified in the options) and open a WebSocket connection.  Every change will be transmitted to the other side.  Each side can close the socket (for example by closing the window) and the session will be automatically over.

  ** Keyboard shortcuts

  These are the default shortcuts, they can be customized in [[https://lifehacker.com/add-custom-keyboard-shortcuts-to-chrome-extensions-for-1595322121][Chrome]] and [[https://support.mozilla.org/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox][Firefox]], but not yet in Safari.
