  * Racket and SICP

  Posted on [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=11804][2023-11-28]] by [[https://irreal.org/blog/?author=2][jcs]]

  As I've written—seemingly hundreds of times—I'm a /huge/ fan of [[https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html][Abelson and Sussman's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)]].  In my opinion, it is one of the best—arguably /the/ best—books on Computer Science.  I read it relatively late in my career (I was already a senior developer and team lead) and it completely changed the way I thought of our discipline.  I learned many, many things that I didn't know or only dimly understood before.
