  * Rendering a ridiculously large Buddhabrot

  This article describes how to render a ridicuously large 500 Megapixel Buddhabrot with iteration depths in the range of millions.  Lisp source included.  Scroll down for the final image.


  [[http://erleuchtet.org/buddhabrot_small_detail.jpg][[[http://erleuchtet.org/assets_c/2010/07/buddhabrot_small_detail-thumb-250x318-365.jpg]]]]Why would you want to do this?  To have it printed and on your wall, of course (see pictures below).

  I will begin by outlining the general idea of the Buddhabrot (see the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot][Wikipedia article]] for more), then talk about my optimizations and rendering choices.
