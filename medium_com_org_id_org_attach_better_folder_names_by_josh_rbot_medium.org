  You might have heard of org-mode headers IDs.  By default, these are Universally Unique Identifiers ( [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier][UUID]] s). In this post, I want to talk about what they are, why I use them (and you should, too), and how to make them into slugs â€” human-readable IDs that make sense.  This will be a bit of a long explanation of what I discovered in org-mode, so buckle up..!
