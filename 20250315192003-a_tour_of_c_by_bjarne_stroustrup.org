  Addison-Wesley. ISBN-10: 0-13-681648-7. September 2022.

  The ``tour'' is a quick (254 pages + index, historical information, etc.) tutorial overview of all of standard C++ (language and standard library) at a moderately high level for people who already know C++ or at least are experienced programmers.  It covers C++20 plus a few likely features of C++23.

  If you are looking for a more complete description of C++ and the styles of programming it supports, consider [[https://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html][The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition)]].

  If you are looking for an an introduction to programming for people who has never programmed before, consider [[https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html][Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++]].  That book is also be useful for people who have programmed a bit and want to improve their style and technique - or to simply learn modern C++.
