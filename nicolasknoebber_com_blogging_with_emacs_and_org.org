  * Blogging with Emacs and Org

  ** 2. Introduction

  Recently I've been using Emacs for more and more of my workflow.  It's great to have the same environment regardless of platform.  Packages like evil-mode, helm and magit make Emacs a joy to use.

  But I had one major annoyance: this website was created with a hodgepodge of HTML, python, and markdown.

  *In this post I describe how I generate my site from Org source files.*

  If you aren't familar with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] or [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] then here's a quick summary: Emacs is a lisp interpreter that comes with functions for editing text.  It's a platform that allows you to build your own IDE. Org is an Emacs extension for writing, formatting, and publishing documents.
