  * Org to Markdown for Hugo

  =ox-hugo= is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]-compatible Markdown ([[https://github.com/russross/blackfriday][Blackfriday]]) and also generates the front-matter (in TOML or YAML format).

  The =ox-hugo= backend extends from a /parent/ backend =ox-blackfriday.el=.  The latter is the one that primarily does the Blackfriday-friendly Markdown content generation.  The main job of =ox-hugo= is to generate the front-matter for each exported content file, and then append that generated Markdown to it.

  There are, though, few functions that =ox-hugo.el= overrides over those by =ox-blackfriday.el=.

  See the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/examples/][Real World Examples]] section to quickly jump to sites generated using =ox-hugo= and their Org sources.
