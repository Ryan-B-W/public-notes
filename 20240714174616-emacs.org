An extensible text editor built using [[id:84ae6e85-a6a2-4133-bc53-274238081c2d][Lisp]].  Usually refers to the current incarnation of GNU Emacs from the FSF.  Known for including everything and the kitchen sink.  Jokingly referred to as the Emacs [[id:412bbcad-6c00-4f13-b748-d1ffde0588e1][operating system]] for how many features it packs in.  Extremely flexible given it's implemented almost entirely in [[id:eac73a7d-f14b-4ec4-bc18-08d864e6c4c0][Emacs Lisp (ELisp)]].
