  : Less is more
  Meow is yet another modal editing mode for [[id:aca1324c-b142-4e34-a121-a8bb0a79ddf8][Emacs]].
  Meow aims to blend modal editing into Emacs with minimal interference with its original key-bindings, avoiding most of the hassle introduced by key-binding conflicts.  This leads to lower necessary configuration and better integration.  More is achieved with fewer commands to remember.
