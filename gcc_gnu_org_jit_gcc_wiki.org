  * Just-In-Time Compilation (libgccjit.so)


  GCC can be built as a shared library "libgccjit.so", for generating machine code from API calls, using GCC as the backend.

  This shared library can then be dynamically-linked into bytecode interpreters and other such programs that want to generate machine code "on the fly" at run-time.

  It can also be used for ahead-of-time code generation, for building standalone compilers (so the "jit" part of the name is now something of a misnomer).

  The library provides a C API, along with a C++ wrapper API, with bindings for languages available from 3rd parties (see below).

  The API is very high-level, and is designed in terms of C semantics (since you're probably going to want to interface with C code).
