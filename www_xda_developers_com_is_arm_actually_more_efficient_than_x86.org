  *** Summary

  - Arm's energy-efficient computing approach has given its partners an edge in power consumption and performance.
  - Intel aims to challenge Arm's efficiency claim with Lunar Lake, but improving x86 will require significant work.
  - While Intel believes x86 can match Arm's efficiency, hardware limitations may hinder immediate gains.

  Arm is often lauded for its efficiency; after all, there's a reason it's become the most pervasive architecture keeping portable devices going for longer.  It's been in our smartphones for well over a decade (sans a brief x86 stint that very few phones took part in), and [[https://www.xda-developers.com/best-laptops/][laptops]] are starting to make the transition thanks to the extended battery life that those machines can get.
