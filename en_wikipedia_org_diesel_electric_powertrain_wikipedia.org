  A diesel–electric transmission, or diesel–electric powertrain, is a transmission system powered by diesel engines for vehicles in road, rail, and marine transport.  Diesel–electric transmission is similar to petrol–electric transmission, which is powered by petrol engines.

  Diesel–electric transmission is used on railways by diesel–electric locomotives and diesel–electric multiple units, as electric motors are able to supply full torque from 0 RPM.  Diesel–electric systems are also used in marine transport, including submarines, and on some other land vehicles.
