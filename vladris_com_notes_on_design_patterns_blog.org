  * Notes on Design Patterns

  : /Patterns mean "I have run out of language."/  --- Rich Hickey.

  Many junior developers want to improve their software design skills by studying design patterns.  I was there too, of course.  I believe there is a big misconception of what design patterns /are/, and I believe we are, indeed, over-indexing on them when we are thinking of software design.

  It is very easy to over-design things, and if blindly apply design patterns, we end up with code like the [[https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition][FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition]], which in real life translate into incomprehensible software that burns hundreds of developer-hours for even tiny changes.
