  The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86][x86]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set][instruction set]] refers to the set of instructions that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86][x86]]-compatible [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor][microprocessors]] support.  The instructions are usually part of an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable][executable]] program, often stored as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file][computer file]] and executed on the processor.

  The x86 instruction set has been extended several times, introducing wider [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(computing)][registers]] and datatypes as well as new functionality.
