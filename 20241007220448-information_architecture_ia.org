  Information architecture (IA) is the structural design of shared information environments; the art and science of organizing and labelling websites, intranets, online communities and software to support usability and findability; and an emerging community of practice focused on bringing principles of design, architecture and information science to the digital landscape.  Typically, it involves a model or concept of information that is used and applied to activities which require explicit details of complex information systems.  These activities include library systems and database development.
