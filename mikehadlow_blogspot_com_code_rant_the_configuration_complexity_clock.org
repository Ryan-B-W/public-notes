  When I was a young coder, just starting out in the big scary world of enterprise software, an older, far more experienced chap gave me a stern warning about hard coding values in my software.  “They /will/ have to change at some point, and you don't want to recompile and redeploy your application just to change the VAT tax rate.”  I took this advice to heart and soon every value that my application needed was loaded from a huge .ini file.  I still think it's good advice, but be warned, like most things in software, it's good advice /up to a point/.  Beyond that point lies pain.

  Let me introduce you to my ‘Configuration Complexity Clock'.
