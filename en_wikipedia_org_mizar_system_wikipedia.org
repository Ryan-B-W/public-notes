  The *Mizar system* consists of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language][formal language]] for writing mathematical definitions and proofs, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant][proof assistant]], which is able to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_proof_checking][mechanically check]] proofs written in this language, and a library of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formalization][formalized mathematics]], which can be used in the proof of new theorems.  The system is maintained and developed by the Mizar Project, formerly under the direction of its founder [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Trybulec][Andrzej Trybulec]].

  In 2009 the Mizar Mathematical Library was the largest coherent body of strictly formalized mathematics in existence.
