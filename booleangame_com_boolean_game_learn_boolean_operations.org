  ** Basic Boolean Operations:

  *&* (conjunction), denoted x & y, satisfies x & y = 1 if x = y = 1 and x & y = 0 otherwise.

  *or* (disjunction), denoted x or y, satisfies x or y = 0 if x = y = 0 and x or y = 1 otherwise.

  *not* (negation), denoted not x, satisfies not x = 0 if x = 1 and not x = 1 if x = 0.

  *nor* (negation of or), denoted not x & not y, satisfies x nor y = 1 if x = y = 0 and x nor y = 0 otherwise.

  ** Game Rules:

  You are given a boolean expression and 9 boxes (3 colors x 3 numbers).

  Click on one or multiple boxes that satisfy the boolean expression.

  You will receive 1 point for every correct box you click on.

  The game is over if you select an incorrect box.

  As you get more points, the boolean expression will get harder.
