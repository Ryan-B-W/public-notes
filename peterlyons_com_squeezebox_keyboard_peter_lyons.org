  * Squeezebox Keyboard

  I designed and built a split ergonomic keyboard with some ideas I've been wanting to try for over a year.  Here are the main features of the keyboard:

  - Split design, obvs
  - staggered linear columns
  - customizable tailor fit column offsets
  - tailor fit per-finger vertical offsets
  - thumb cluster with 6 keys
