#+begin_quote
  This file contains library functions and commands useful for retrieving web page content and processing it into Org-mode content.
  For example, you can copy a URL to the clipboard or kill-ring, then run a command that downloads the page, isolates the “readable” content with eww-readable, converts it to Org-mode content with Pandoc, and displays it in an Org-mode buffer.  Another command does all of that but inserts it as an Org entry instead of displaying it in a new buffer.
