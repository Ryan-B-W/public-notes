  * Revised^{7} Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme

  Revised Revised Revised Revised Revised Revised Revised

  Scheme is a programming language designed with an emphasis on building abstractions out of simple, composable primitives.

  This website covers the ongoing seventh revision of the specification since 1975, divided into two parts: a small language primarily for embedding, education, and research; and a large language to address the practical needs of mainstream software development.

  ** Small language

  The R^{7}RS small language was completed in 2013.

  - Small language report ([[https://standards.scheme.org/official/r7rs.pdf][PDF]], [[https://github.com/johnwcowan/r7rs-work/blob/master/R7RSSmallErrata.md][errata]])
  - Unofficial edition with errata corrected ([[https://standards.scheme.org/unofficial/errata-corrected-r7rs.pdf][PDF]], [[https://standards.scheme.org/corrected-r7rs/r7rs.html][HTML]])
  - [[https://small.r7rs.org/][Wiki and issue tracker archive]]

  ** Large language

  Development of the R^{7}RS large language is ongoing.
