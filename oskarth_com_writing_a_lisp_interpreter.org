  * Writing A Lisp Interpreter

  /2015-06-14/

  I've always really liked Lisp as a programming language, but I've yet to write an interpreter for the language.  This week I decided to change that.

  *Hypothesis:* I can write a lisp interpreter in under 500 LOCs and in under a week.

  Since the beginning of last week I've been keeping a [[https://twitter.com/oskarth/status/608397165925437441][code journal]].  To give you a feel for process so far of this project, I'm posting some excerpts from it related to this project.
