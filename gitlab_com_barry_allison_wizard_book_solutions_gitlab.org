  * YASICP

  Yes another SICP solutions repository.

  These solutions use [[http://racket-lang.org/][Racket]] but any more recent version should work.  Some of the exercises use other libraries - notably [[http://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html][the SICP language]] I've tried to check that all exercises actually run - wherever it's appropriate.

  Caveat developor!
