  * Context-Free Grammars

  Context-free languages are useful for studying computer languages as well
  as human languages.

  - Context-free languages are recognized by push-down automata (PDA) in the same way that regular languages are recognized by ﬁnite automata.
  - A push-down automaton has an inﬁnite amount of memory but it is only accessed in a last-in ﬁrst-out (LIFO) manner, that is, like a stack.
  - Thus push-down automata are more powerful than ﬁnite automata; for example, {anbn : n ≥ 0} is a context-free language.
  - But push-down automata are less powerful than Turing machines, which we'll study later.
  - Turing machines have an inﬁnite amount of memory that can be accessed in an arbitrary manner.
