  This is a guide to getting started writing ebuilds, to harness the power of Portage, to install and manage even more software.
  Write an ebuild to install a piece of software on Gentoo, when there are no suitable preexisting ebuilds.  It's a relatively straight forward task, and is the only way to cleanly install most "third party" software system-wide.  The ebuild will allow the package manager to track every file installed to the system, to allow clean updates and removal.
