#+begin_quote
  HSLuv is a [[https://www.boronine.com/2012/03/26/Color-Spaces-for-Human-Beings/][human-friendly]] alternative to HSL.

  Here you can see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELUV][CIELUV]], a color space designed for perceptual uniformity based on human experiments.  When accessed by polar coordinates, it becomes functionally similar to HSL with a single problem: its chroma component doesn't fit into a specific range.

  HSLuv extends CIELUV with a new saturation component that allows you to span all the available chroma as a neat percentage.
