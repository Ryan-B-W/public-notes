  ** Actually Portable Executables

  I came across [[https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan][Cosmopolitan]] on Hacker News, and I was initially confused, due to a few memories of cross-compilation nightmares: while it should be possible to compile for the same architecture regardless of operating system, wouldn't the OS get confused by the leading bytes of the executable? I read the [[https://justine.lol/ape.html][article]] explaining how it works, but most of it went over my head.

  The example on the [[https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan][Github README]] used the following script for compilation:

  #+begin_src chroma :tabindex 0
  gcc -g -O -static -nostdlib -nostdinc -fno-pie -no-pie -mno-red-zone   -o hello.com.dbg hello.c -fuse-ld=bfd -Wl,-T,ape.lds   -include cosmopolitan.h crt.o ape.o cosmopolitan.a
  objcopy -S -O binary hello.com.dbg hello.com
  #+end_src

  I converted it into a simple Makefile to run the compilation commands. I tried a bunch of simple C programs (basic arithmetic, reading and writing to files) on Linux+Windows (compiled on Linux), and all of them worked.
