  * Stacked Borrows 2

  Recently, I have [[https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/pull/695][significantly updated]] Stacked Borrows in order to fix some issues with the handling of shared references that were uncovered in the previous version.  In this post, I will describe what the new version looks like and how it differs from [[https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/11/16/stacked-borrows-implementation.html][Stacked Borrows 1]].  I assume some familiarity with the prior version and will not explain everything from scratch.
