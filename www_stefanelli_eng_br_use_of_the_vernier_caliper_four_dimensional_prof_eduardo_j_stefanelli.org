  : Use of the vernier caliper or dial caliper or digital caliper- four-dimensional

  The vernier caliper is a measurement tool equiped with one scale and a cursor that slides in itself and it was designed to take linear dimensions by contact.

  The most popular type in mechanical workshops is the one equiped with nonius, but, usually, all kinds are enabled to take external, internal, depth and rebound measurements.

  - To comprehend the science of the measuring with caliper, we suggest you to read and interact with the simulators on the pages:
    - [[https://www.stefanelli.eng.br/en/virtual-vernier-caliper-reading-tenths-millimeter-simulator/][Simulator of reading nd interpretation of vernier scale in millimeter, tenth resolution]]
    - [[https://www.stefanelli.eng.br/en/virtual-vernier-caliper-millimeter-simulator-05/][Virtual vernier caliper -- simulator of use and reading, resolution five hundredths of millimeter 0.05mm]]

  Some caliper models are four-dimensional, this means that it can be used in four different ways in the measurement.
