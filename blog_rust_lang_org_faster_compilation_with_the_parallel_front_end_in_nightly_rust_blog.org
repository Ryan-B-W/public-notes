#+begin_quote
  The Rust compiler's front-end can now use parallel execution to significantly reduce compile times.  To try it, run the nightly compiler with the -Z threads=8 option.  This feature is currently experimental, and we aim to ship it in the stable compiler in 2024.

  Keep reading to learn why a parallel front-end is needed and how it works, or just skip ahead to the How to use it section.
