  The *TI-89* and the *TI-89 Titanium* are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphing_calculator][graphing calculators]] developed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments][Texas Instruments]] (TI).  They are differentiated from most other TI graphing calculators by their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system][computer algebra system]], which allows symbolic manipulation of algebraic expressions—equations can be solved in terms of variables—whereas the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83][TI-83]]/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-84][84]] series can only give a numeric result.
