  *Johnson--Nyquist noise* (*thermal noise*, *Johnson noise*, or *Nyquist noise*) is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage][voltage]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current][current]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics)][noise]] generated by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy][thermal agitation]] of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_carrier][charge carriers]] (usually the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron][electrons]]) inside an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor][electrical conductor]] at equilibrium, which happens regardless of any applied voltage.  Thermal noise is present in all [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_circuit][electrical circuits]], and in sensitive electronic equipment (such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_receiver][radio receivers]]) can drown out weak signals, and can be the limiting factor on sensitivity of electrical measuring instruments.  Thermal noise is proportional to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_temperature][absolute temperature]], so some sensitive electronic equipment such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope][radio telescope]] receivers are cooled to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic][cryogenic]] temperatures to improve their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio][signal-to-noise ratio]].  The generic, statistical physical derivation of this noise is called the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluctuation-dissipation_theorem][fluctuation-dissipation theorem]], where generalized [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance][impedance]] or generalized [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_susceptibility][susceptibility]] is used to characterize the medium.

  Thermal noise in an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_resistor][ideal resistor]] is approximately [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise][white]], meaning that its power [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density][spectral density]] is nearly constant throughout the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_spectrum][frequency spectrum]] (Figure 2).  When limited to a finite bandwidth and viewed in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_domain][time domain]] (as sketched in Figure 1), thermal noise has a nearly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution][Gaussian amplitude distribution]].

  For the general case, this definition applies to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_carriers][charge carriers]] in any type of conducting [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium][medium]] (e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion][ions]] in an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte][electrolyte]]), not just [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor][resistors]].  Thermal noise is distinct from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise][shot noise]], which consists of additional current fluctuations that occur when a voltage is applied and a macroscopic current starts to flow.
