  * LISP with GC in 436 bytes

  [[https://github.com/jart/sectorlisp][SectorLISP]] now supports garbage collection.  This is the first time that a high-level garbage collected programming language has been optimized to fit inside the 512-byte boot sector of a floppy disk.  Since we only needed 436 bytes, that means LISP has now outdistanced [[https://github.com/cesarblum/sectorforth][FORTH]] and [[https://github.com/nanochess/bootBASIC][BASIC]] to be the tiniest programming language in the world.
