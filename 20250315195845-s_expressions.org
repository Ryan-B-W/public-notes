  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming][computer programming]], an *S-expression* (or *symbolic expression*, abbreviated as *sexpr* or *sexp*) is an expression in a like-named notation for nested [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(computing)][list]] ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)][tree]]-structured) data.  S-expressions were invented for, and popularized by, the programming language [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)][Lisp]], which uses them for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code][source code]] as well as data.
