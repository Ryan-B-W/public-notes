  * Goblins: Distributed, Transactional Programming

  At the heart of Spritely is Goblins, its /distributed object programming/ environment.  Goblins provides an intuitive security model, automatic local transactions for locally synchronous operations, and an easy to use and efficient asynchronous programming interface for /encapsulated objects/ which can live anywhere on the network.  Its networking model abstracts away these details so the programmer can focus on object programming rather than protocol architecture.

  Goblins also integrates powerful distributed debugging tools, and a process persistence and upgrade model which respects its security fundamentals.
