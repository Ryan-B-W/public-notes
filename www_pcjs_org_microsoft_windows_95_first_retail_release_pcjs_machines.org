  ** Microsoft Windows 95: First Retail Release

  Windows 95 was the successor to Windows 3.1 and included a number of important new features:

  - Support for 32-bit Windows applications
  - Long mixed-case filenames (up to 255 characters)
  - GUI improvements (e.g., Explorer, *Start* button, Taskbar, shortcuts)

  It was also first version of Windows that /required/ an 80386 CPU (preferably a D-stepping or later).

  Windows 95 was released to manufacturing on July 14, 1995 and went on sale at midnight on August 24, 1995.

  It is shown running below, following a “Compact Installation” on a 68Mb hard disk.  Before the machine can start, it must download the disk image, which may take a minute or two, depending on the speed of your internet connection.
