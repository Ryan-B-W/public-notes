#+title: Hypertext
#+filetags: :writing:computer_science:

A form of non-linear document collection which contains hyperlinks to other documents, other documents at specific points, or even the same document but at a specific point.  Theses hypertext documents also typically contain various forms of formatting and often contain content other than just plain text such as images, audio, and video.

The concept was originally conceived of by [[id:e5a582e4-16fb-4fd3-b182-07abf5720ee1][Vannevar Bush]] in 1945 and the terms hypertext and hypermedia where coined by [[id:33d5bcba-4e40-45e8-9c15-282f356046d5][Ted Nelson]] in 1963.

Interestingly, [[id:aca1324c-b142-4e34-a121-a8bb0a79ddf8][Emacs]] may be the best example of fully utilizing hypertext.
