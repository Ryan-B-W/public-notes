  /*Ergonomic Keyboard Generator*/

  The project aims to provide a common configuration format to describe /*ergonomic*/ 2D layouts and generate automatic plates, cases, as well as un-routed PCBs for them.  The project grew out of (and is an integral part of) the [[https://zealot.hu/absolem][Absolem keyboard]], and shares its [[http://discord.ergogen.xyz/][Discord]] server as well.
