  * Environment-Passing Style

  Functions of type A → B can be translated into corresponding functions of type ¬B → ¬A in continuation-passing style (CPS), where ¬A is logically negation but computationally a continuation from A.

  This widens the view of functions as value transformers, taking values of type A to values of type B, to include an alternative perspective of them as continuation transformers (as noted by Andrzej Filinski in /Declarative Continuations and Categorical Duality/.)

  Logic and computation are [[https://antitypical.com/posts/2021-06-07-duality/][rife with dualities]], leading one to wonder: what's the dual of CPS?
