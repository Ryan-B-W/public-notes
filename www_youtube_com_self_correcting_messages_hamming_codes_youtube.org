  Heavily related is the chessboard puzzle I did with Matt Parker: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as7Gkm7Y7h4][The almost impossible chessboard puzzle]]

  You can read Hamming's own perspective on his discovery of these codes in chapter 12 of "The Art of Doing Science and Engineering".\\

  These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open-source python library: [[https://github.com/3b1b/manim][https://github.com/3b1b/manim]]

  If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.
