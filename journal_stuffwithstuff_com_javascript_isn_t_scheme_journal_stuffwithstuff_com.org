  It seems like I can't spend five minutes on reddit these days without someone playing the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1g7gw7/the_angular_team_is_porting_angularjs_to_dart/cahzqav][JS-is-Scheme is card]]. I see everything from the innocuous, “JavaScript has a lot in common with Scheme”, all the way up to, “JavaScript is basically Scheme.” This is basically crazy. Or, at least it has a lot in common with crazy.

  Before I convince you that it's crazy, let's step back a bit and ask why would JS adherents make a statement like this to begin with? You don't hear people saying, “Yeah, FORTRAN is basically Icon” or “Sather has a really solid SNOBOL core,” do you? Why this arbitrary pairing? After meticulous scientific research, I've discovered two historical reasons and one weird psychological one.
