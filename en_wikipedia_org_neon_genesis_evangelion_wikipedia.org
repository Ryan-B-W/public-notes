  /*Neon Genesis Evangelion*/ ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language][Japanese]]: 新世紀エヴァンゲリオン, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization][Hepburn]]: /Shinseiki Evangerion/, lit. 'New Century Evangelion' in Japanese and lit. 'New Beginning [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_gospel][Gospel]]' in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language][Greek]]), also known as /*Evangelion*/ or /*Eva*/, is a Japanese [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha_anime_and_manga][mecha anime]] television series produced by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainax][Gainax]], animated by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsunoko_Production][Tatsunoko]], and directed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideaki_Anno][Hideaki Anno]].  It was broadcast on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Tokyo][TV Tokyo]] from October 1995 to March 1996.  The story is set fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm in the futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3.  The protagonist is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinji_Ikari][Shinji Ikari]], a teenage boy recruited by his father [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendo_Ikari][Gendo]] to the mysterious organization Nerv.  Shinji must pilot an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelion_(mecha)][Evangelion]], a giant biomechanical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha][mecha]], to fight beings known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_(Neon_Genesis_Evangelion)][Angels]].

  The series explores the experiences and emotions of the Evangelion pilots and Nerv members as they battle Angels.  They are called upon to understand the ultimate cause of events and the motives behind human action.  The series has been described as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction][deconstruction]] of the mecha genre, and features [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype][archetypal]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themes_of_Neon_Genesis_Evangelion][imagery]] derived from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto#Cosmology_and_afterlife][Shinto cosmology]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism][mystical]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_Judaism][Judeo-Christian]] traditions, including [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash][Midrashic]] tales and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah][Kabbalah]].  The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis][psychoanalytic]] accounts of human behavior put forward by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud][Freud]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jung][Jung]] are prominently featured.

  /Neon Genesis Evangelion/ is widely considered one of the greatest anime series of all time.  Its final two episodes drew controversy, as many viewers found the ending confusing and abstract.  In 1997, Anno and Gainax released the feature film /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Evangelion][The End of Evangelion]]/, serving as an alternate ending.  A series of four films, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuild_of_Evangelion][Rebuild of Evangelion]]/, retelling the events of the series with different plot elements and a new ending, were released between 2007 and 2021.  Film, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga][manga]], home video, and other products in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion_(franchise)][/Evangelion/ franchise]] have achieved record sales in Japanese markets and strong sales in overseas markets, with related goods selling over ¥150 billion by 2007 and /Evangelion/ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko][pachinko]] machines generating ¥700 billion by 2015.
