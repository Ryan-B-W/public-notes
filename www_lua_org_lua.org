  Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.  It supports procedural programming, [[id:1a857a79-1bc3-42c2-92ee-897a864b10de][object-oriented programming]], functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.

  Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics.  Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
