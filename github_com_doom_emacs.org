  : It's a tale as old as time: a stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic vimmer -- tormented by Vimscript and his boundless productivity -- makes a formal request to the netherworld for a transfer.  They agree.  The terms?  He must lure more unsuspecting souls into a life of eternal bikeshedding.  Now he runs the place.

  Doom Emacs is a configuration framework for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] with an optional starter kit attached.  It's tailored for [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsBankruptcy][bankruptcy veterans]] seeking a faster, more reliable, and reproducible foundation for their next config, or for beginners who want a softer introduction to our favorite operating system.
