  The Design Trilogy is the collective name of a series of three documentary films about design directed by film director Gary Hustwit.
  The films are:
   - 2007: Helvetica, on the famous typeface of the same name
   - 2009: Objectified, on industrial design
   - 2011: Urbanized, on architecture and urban design
  Later in 2013 through crowdfunding, Hustwit began editing and compiling transcripts of the interviews with his subjects into a book.  It was subsequently completed and released in 2015.
