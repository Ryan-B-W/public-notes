  *Model-driven engineering* (*MDE*) is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_methodology][software development methodology]] that focuses on creating and exploiting [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model][domain models]], which are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model_(computer_science)][conceptual models]] of all the topics related to a specific problem.  Hence, it highlights and aims at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(mathematics)][abstract representations]] of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning][knowledge]] and activities that govern a particular [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(software_engineering)][application domain]], rather than the computing (i.e. algorithmic) concepts.

  MDE is a subfield of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design][software design]] approach referred as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_engineering][round-trip engineering]].  The scope of the MDE is much wider than that of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture][Model-Driven Architecture]].
