  What's the difference between a Canoe and Kayak?  Well the difference is relatively simple; it’s related to athlete’s position in the boat and the type of paddle they use to propel the boat.
  In a kayak, the paddler is seated and uses a double-bladed paddle pulling the blade through the water on alternate sides to move forward.
  In a canoe, the paddler kneels and uses a single-bladed paddle to propel the boat forward.
