#+title: Unified Modeling Language (UML)

Visual language used for describing systems at various levels of detail.  Often used at an excessively low level of abstraction where it covers too much detail to be useful.  Incorporates many existing diagram conventions into one system to varying degrees of success.  Commonly used in legacy waterfall method software development.
