  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics][mathematics]], the *Chinese remainder theorem* states that if one knows the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division][remainders of the Euclidean division]] of an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer][integer]] /n/ by several integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of /n/ by the product of these integers, under the condition that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor][divisors]] are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairwise_coprime][pairwise coprime]] (no two divisors share a common factor other than 1).

  The theorem is sometimes called *Sunzi's theorem*.  Both names of the theorem refer to its earliest known statement that appeared in /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunzi_Suanjing][Sunzi Suanjing]]/, a Chinese manuscript written during the 3rd to 5th century CE.  This first statement was restricted to the following example:

  If one knows that the remainder of /n/ divided by 3 is 2, the remainder of /n/ divided by 5 is 3, and the remainder of /n/ divided by 7 is 2, then with no other information, one can determine the remainder of /n/ divided by 105 (the product of 3, 5, and 7) without knowing the value of /n/.  In this example, the remainder is 23.  Moreover, this remainder is the only possible positive value of /n/ that is less than 105.

  The Chinese remainder theorem is widely used for computing with large integers, as it allows replacing a computation for which one knows a bound on the size of the result by several similar computations on small integers.

  The Chinese remainder theorem (expressed in terms of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic#Congruence][congruences]]) is true over every [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_ideal_domain][principal ideal domain]].  It has been generalized to any [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)][ring]], with a formulation involving [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_ideal][two-sided ideals]].
