  For seven years, Paul Lockhart’s A Mathematician’s Lament enjoyed a samizdat-style popularity in the mathematics underground, before demand prompted its 2009 publication to even wider applause and debate.  An impassioned critique of K–12 mathematics education, it outlined how we shortchange students by introducing them to math the wrong way.  Here Lockhart offers the positive side of the math education story by showing us how math should be done.  Measurement offers a permanent solution to math phobia by introducing us to mathematics as an artful way of thinking and living.
