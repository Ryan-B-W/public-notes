  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics][mathematics]], *Church encoding* is a means of representing data and operators in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus][lambda calculus]].  The *Church numerals* are a representation of the natural numbers using lambda notation.  The method is named for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church][Alonzo Church]], who first encoded data in the lambda calculus this way.

  Terms that are usually considered primitive in other notations (such as integers, Booleans, pairs, lists, and tagged unions) are mapped to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function][higher-order functions]] under Church encoding.  The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchâ€“Turing_thesis][Church--Turing thesis]] asserts that any computable operator (and its operands) can be represented under Church encoding.  In the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus][untyped lambda calculus]] the only primitive data type is the function.
