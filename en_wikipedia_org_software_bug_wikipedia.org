  A *software bug* is a design defect ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_(engineering)][bug]]) in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software][computer software]].  A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program][computer program]] with many or serious bugs may be described as /buggy/.

  The effects of a software bug range from minor (such as a misspelled word in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface][user interface]]) to severe (such as frequent [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_(computing)][crashing]]).

  In 2002, a study commissioned by the US [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Commerce][Department of Commerce]]'s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology][National Institute of Standards and Technology]] concluded that "software bugs, or errors, are so prevalent and so detrimental that they cost the US economy an estimated $59 billion annually, or about 0.6 percent of the gross domestic product".

  Since the 1950s, some computer systems have been designed to detect or auto-correct various software errors during operations.
