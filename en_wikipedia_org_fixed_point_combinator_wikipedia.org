  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic][combinatory logic]] for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science][computer science]], a *fixed-point combinator* (or *fixpoint combinator*) is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function][higher-order function]] (i.e. a function which takes a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)][function]] as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function][argument]]) that returns some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)][/fixed point/]] (a value that is mapped to itself) of its argument function, if one exists.

  Formally, if \(\text{fix}\) is a fixed-point combinator and the function \(f\) has one or more fixed points, then \(\text{fix}f\) is one of these fixed points, i.e.

  \(f(\text{fix}f) = \text{fix}f.\)

  Fixed-point combinators can be defined in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus][lambda calculus]] and in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming_language][functional programming languages]] and provide a means to allow for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)][recursive definitions]].
