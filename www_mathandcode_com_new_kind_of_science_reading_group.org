  * New Kind of Science Reading Group

  These are the meeting notes and associated notebooks for a reading group on A New Kind of Science.  Our goals in this reading group are to read (or re-read) Stephen Wolfram's A New Kind of Science, and also to collect the code snippets and ideas of all reading group attendees.  At the end, we want to end up with curated notebooks containing all of our interesting ideas, questions, and code snippets

  We have meetings every Sunday at 10:00am PST / 11:00am CDMX.
