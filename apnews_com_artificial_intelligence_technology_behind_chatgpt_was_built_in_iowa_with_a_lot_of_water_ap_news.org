** On water use of ChatGPT
#+begin_quote
  In a paper due to be published later this year, Ren’s team estimates ChatGPT gulps up 500 milliliters of water (close to what’s in a 16-ounce water bottle) every time you ask it a series of between 5 to 50 prompts or questions.  The range varies depending on where its servers are located and the season.  The estimate includes indirect water usage that the companies don’t measure — such as to cool power plants that supply the data centers with electricity.
