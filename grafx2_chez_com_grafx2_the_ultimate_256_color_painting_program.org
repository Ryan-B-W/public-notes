#+filetags: :image_editing:website:software:

#+begin_quote
  GrafX2 is a bitmap paint program inspired by the Amiga programs â€‹Deluxe Paint and Brilliance.  Specialized in 256-color drawing, it includes a very large number of tools and effects that make it particularly suitable for pixel art, game graphics, and generally any detailed graphics painted with a mouse.
  The program is mostly developed on Haiku, Linux and Windows, but is also portable on many other platforms.
