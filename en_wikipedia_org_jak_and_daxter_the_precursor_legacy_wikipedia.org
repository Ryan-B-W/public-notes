  /*Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy*/ is a 2001 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platformer][platform]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game][video game]] developed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naughty_Dog][Naughty Dog]] and published by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment#History][Sony Computer Entertainment]] for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2][PlayStation 2]] (PS2).  The player controls Jak, who sets out to reverse the transformation of his friend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_the_Jak_and_Daxter_series#Daxter][Daxter]] into an "ottsel", a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_fictional_species][fictional hybrid]] of an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otter][otter]] and a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel][weasel]].  This quest eventually turns into an effort to stop a rogue sage from corrupting the world.  The game takes place in a cohesive and non-linear world, allowing the player to freely explore interconnected areas.

  The game was conceived during development of /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Team_Racing][Crash Team Racing]]/ (1999), Naughty Dog's final /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot][Crash Bandicoot]]/ game.  Pursuing a new [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property][intellectual property]], the company envisioned a seamless 3D [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game][action-adventure]] that leveraged the PS2's capabilities.  Development involved building a new engine using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp][Game Oriented Assembly Lisp]] (GOAL), a custom language for real-time code changes, as well as recruiting animators from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company][Disney]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon][Nickelodeon]].  Naughty Dog was acquired by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony][Sony]] during production, providing financial stability.  Public anticipation for the game was high prior to its unveiling at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3#Events][E3 2001]], where its title was revealed.

  /Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy/ was critically acclaimed upon release.  Reviewers lauded the game's visuals and technical achievements, particularly its open seamless world devoid of load times, which were said to set a new standard for platformers.  Praise also went to its gameplay polish, controls, sound effects, and voice acting.  Reactions to the music and difficulty were mixed, and criticisms were directed toward the gameplay's lack of innovation, lack of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)][bosses]], simplistic story, and short length.  By 2002, the game had sold over one million copies worldwide, and by 2007, it had sold two million copies in the United States alone.  It is the first installment in the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter][Jak and Daxter]]/ series, with the first sequel, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_II][Jak II]]/, being released in 2003.
