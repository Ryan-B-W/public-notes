  *Plan 9 from Bell Labs* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_operating_system][distributed operating system]] which originated from the Computing Science Research Center (CSRC) at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs][Bell Labs]] in the mid-1980s and built on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX][UNIX]] concepts first developed there in the late 1960s.  Since 2000, Plan 9 has been [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software][free and open-source]].  The final official release was in early 2015.

  Under Plan 9, UNIX's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file][everything is a file]]/ metaphor is extended via a pervasive network-centric [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system][filesystem]], and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addressable_cursor][cursor-addressed]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal][terminal]]-based [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output][I/O]] at the heart of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like][UNIX-like]] operating systems is replaced by a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowing_system][windowing system]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface][graphical user interface]] without cursor addressing, although [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rc_(Unix_shell)][rc]], the Plan 9 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)][shell]], is text-based.

  The name /Plan 9 from Bell Labs/ is a reference to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Wood][Ed Wood]] 1957 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film][cult]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction][science fiction]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-movie][Z-movie]] /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Outer_Space][Plan 9 from Outer Space]]/.  The system continues to be used and developed by operating system researchers and hobbyists.
