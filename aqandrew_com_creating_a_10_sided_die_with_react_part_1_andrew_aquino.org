  * Creating a 10-Sided Die with React, Part 1

  Published February 10, 2021

  This is a 10-sided die.  Below is my attempt to recreate one with JavaScript---just the shape for now.  Click it to see it move!

  Check out the latest code [[https://github.com/aqandrew/react-3d-dice][on GitHub]] or [[https://codesandbox.io/s/github/dawneraq/react-3d-dice][in CodeSandbox]].

  You can create 3D graphics with React!  This is how I built a custom three.js geometry to use in react-three-fiber.  Hopefully documenting my process can help someone get started^{*} with 3D programming.

  I'm assuming that you have some basic knowledge of three.js and React.  I'm no expert; that's all I had when I figured this stuff out.

  Also, I hope you like math.
