  * topsy.el

  This library shows a sticky header at the top of the window.  The header shows which definition the top line of the window is within.  It's intended as a simple alternative to =semantic-stickyfunc-mode=.  It's especially helpful when, for example, browsing a list of =occur= results: when a line is in the middle of a definition, and the top of the definition is beyond the top of the window, =topsy= shows what definition the line is in.

  Mode-specific functions may be added to =topsy-mode-functions=.

  *NOTE:* For Org mode buffers, please use [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sticky-header][org-sticky-header]].
