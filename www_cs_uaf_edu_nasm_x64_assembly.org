  * x86_64 NASM Assembly Quick Reference ("Cheat Sheet")

  Here's the full list of ordinary integer x86 registers.  The 64 bit registers are shown in red.  "Scratch" registers any function is allowed to overwrite, and use for anything you want without asking anybody.  "/Preserved/" registers have to be put back ("save" the register) if you use them.
