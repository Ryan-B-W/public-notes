#+title: (github.com) oantolin/orderless: Emacs completion style that matches multiple regexps in any order
#+filetags: :programming:software:emacs_lisp:lisp:emacs:website:

#+begin_quote
  This package provides an orderless completion style that divides the pattern into space-separated components, and matches candidates that match all of the components in any order.  Each component can match in any one of several ways: literally, as a regexp, as an initialism, in the flex style, or as multiple word prefixes.  By default, regexp and literal matches are enabled.
