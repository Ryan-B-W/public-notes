  * How Core Git Developers Configure Git

  What `git config` settings should be defaults by now? Here are some settings that even the core developers change.

  [[https://blog.gitbutler.com/tag/git/][git]]

  A few weeks ago I [[https://blog.gitbutler.com/why-is-git-autocorrect-too-fast-for-formula-one-drivers/][wrote about]] Git's =help.autocorrect= setting and the strange tale of the origin of it's deciseconds value.

  It got me to thinking about other =git config= settings that most people likely don't know about and which should probably be defaulted differently.

  In this post, I'll go through some of the perhaps obscure Git config settings that I have personally globally enabled and go into them to explain what they do and why they should /probably/ be the default settings.

  Also, it turns out that I learned most of these from the people who actually work on the core Git codebase every day.

  ** TLDR

  First, though, some of you may not particularly care about the wonderful and sordid history of the =rerere= values or whatever. You may just be thinking â€œjust give me the settings so I can blindly throw them into my =~/.gitconfig= file."

  Well, fair enough. Here is the fun stuff:

  #+begin_src ini
    # clearly makes git better

    [column]
            ui = auto
    [branch]
            sort = -committerdate
    [tag]
            sort = version:refname
    [init]
            defaultBranch = main
    [diff]
            algorithm = histogram
            colorMoved = plain
            mnemonicPrefix = true
            renames = true
    [push]
            default = simple
            autoSetupRemote = true
            followTags = true
    [fetch]
            prune = true
            pruneTags = true
            all = true

    # why the hell not?

    [help]
            autocorrect = prompt
    [commit]
            verbose = true
    [rerere]
            enabled = true
            autoupdate = true
    [core]
            excludesfile = ~/.gitignore
    [rebase]
            autoSquash = true
            autoStash = true
            updateRefs = true

    # a matter of taste (uncomment if you dare)

    [core]
            # fsmonitor = true
            # untrackedCache = true
    [merge]
            # (just 'diff3' if git version < 2.3)
            # conflictstyle = zdiff3
    [pull]
            # rebase = true
    #+end_src

    Copypasta, my friends.
