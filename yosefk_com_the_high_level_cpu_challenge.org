  * The "high-level CPU" challenge

  January 29th, 2008

  Do you love ("very") high-level languages?  Like Lisp, Smalltalk, Python, Ruby?  Or maybe Haskell, ML?  I love high-level languages.

  Do you think high-level languages would run fast if the stock hardware weren't "brain-damaged"/"built to run C"/"a von Neumann machine (instead of some other wonderful thing)"?  You do think so?  I have a challenge for you.  I bet you'll be interested.
