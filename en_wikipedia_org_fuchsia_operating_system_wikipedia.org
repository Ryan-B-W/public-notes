  Fuchsia is an open-source capability-based operating system developed by Google.  In contrast to Google's Linux-based operating systems such as ChromeOS and Android, Fuchsia is based on a custom kernel named Zircon.  It publicly debuted as a self-hosted git repository in August 2016 without any official corporate announcement.  After years of development, its official product launch was in 2021 on the first-generation Google Nest Hub, replacing its original Linux-based Cast OS.
