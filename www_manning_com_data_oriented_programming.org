  Data-Oriented Programming: Reduce software complexity

  *Eliminate the unavoidable complexity of object-oriented designs.  The innovative data-oriented programming paradigm makes your systems less complex by making it simpler to access and manipulate data.*

  In /Data-Oriented Programming/ you will learn how to:


  - Separate code from data
  - Represent data with generic data structures
  - Manipulate data with general-purpose functions
  - Manage state without mutating data
  - Control concurrency in highly scalable systems
  - Write data-oriented unit tests
  - Specify the shape of your data
  - Benefit from polymorphism without objects
  - Debug programs without a debugger

  /Data-Oriented Programming/ is a one-of-a-kind guide that introduces the data-oriented paradigm.  This groundbreaking approach represents data with generic immutable data structures.  It simplifies state management, eases concurrency, and does away with the common problems you'll find in object-oriented code.  The book presents powerful new ideas through conversations, code snippets, and diagrams that help you quickly grok what's great about DOP. Best of all, the paradigm is language-agnostic---you'll learn to write DOP code that can be implemented in JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Clojure, and also in traditional OO languages like Java or C#.

  ** about the technology

   Code that combines behavior and data, as is common in object-oriented designs, can introduce almost unmanageable complexity for state management.  The Data-oriented programming (DOP) paradigm simplifies state management by holding application data in immutable generic data structures and then performing calculations using non-mutating general-purpose functions.  Your applications are free of state-related bugs and your code is easier to understand and maintain.

  ** about the book

   /Data-Oriented Programming/ teaches you to design software using the groundbreaking data-oriented paradigm.  You'll put DOP into action to design data models for business entities and implement a library management system that manages state without data mutation.  The numerous diagrams, intuitive mind maps, and a unique conversational approach all help you get your head around these exciting new ideas.  Every chapter has a lightbulb moment that will change the way you think about programming.
