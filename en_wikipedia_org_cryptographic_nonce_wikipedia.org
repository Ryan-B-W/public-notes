  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography][cryptography]], a *nonce* is an arbitrary number that can be used just once in a cryptographic communication.  It is often a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness][random]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness][pseudo-random]] number issued in an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication_protocol][authentication protocol]] to ensure that each communication session is unique, and therefore that old communications cannot be reused in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack][replay attacks]].  Nonces can also be useful as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector][initialization vectors]] and in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_functions][cryptographic hash functions]].
