#+begin_quote
  The concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined, and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events.  A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events.  The use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems.  The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.
