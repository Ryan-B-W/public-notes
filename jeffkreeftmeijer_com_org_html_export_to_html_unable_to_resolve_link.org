  * org-html-export-to-html: Unable to resolve link

  By [[https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/][Jeff Kreeftmeijer]] on 2023-02-28 (originally published on 2023-02-26)

  When generating HTML from Org files that have ID-based links, sometimes =org-html-export-to-html= is unable to resolve links:

  : Unable to resolve link: "16A4875E-F1B7-4DEE-940C-0E1EDF09B27B"

  This happens because the file isn't loaded, so Org doesn't yet know about its existence.

  To resolve this, use =org-roam-update-org-id-locations= over all files that are linked to from the file that's being exported.  For example, if all files are in the =~/notes= directory, run =org-id-update-id-locations= with a list of all org files in that directory [[https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/emacs-find-files-recursively/][recursively]]:

  #+begin_src elisp
    (org-id-update-id-locations (directory-files-recursively "~/notes" "\.org$") )
  #+end_src
#+end_quote
