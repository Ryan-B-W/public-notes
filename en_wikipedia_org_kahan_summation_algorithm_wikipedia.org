  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis][numerical analysis]], the *Kahan summation algorithm*, also known as *compensated summation*, significantly reduces the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_error][numerical error]] in the total obtained by adding a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence][sequence]] of finite-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_precision][precision]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_number][floating-point numbers]], compared to the naive approach.  This is done by keeping a separate /running compensation/ (a variable to accumulate small errors), in effect extending the precision of the sum by the precision of the compensation variable.

  In particular, simply summing \(n\) numbers in sequence has a worst-case error that grows proportional to \(n\), and a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square][root mean square]] error that grows as \(\sqrt{n}\) for random inputs (the roundoff errors form a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk][random walk]]).  With compensated summation, using a compensation variable with sufficiently high precision the worst-case error bound is effectively independent of \(n\), so a large number of values can be summed with an error that only depends on the floating-point [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(arithmetic)][precision]] of the result.

  The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm][algorithm]] is attributed to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kahan][William Kahan]]; [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Babuška][Ivo Babuška]] seems to have come up with a similar algorithm independently (hence *Kahan--Babuška summation*).  Similar, earlier techniques are, for example, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham's_line_algorithm][Bresenham's line algorithm]], keeping track of the accumulated error in integer operations (although first documented around the same time) and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation][delta-sigma modulation]].
