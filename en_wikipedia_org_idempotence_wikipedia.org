  *Idempotence* ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English][UK]]: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English][/ˌɪdɛmˈpoʊtəns/]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English][US]]: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English][/ˈaɪdəm-/]]) is the property of certain [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)][operations]] in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics][mathematics]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science][computer science]] whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.  The concept of idempotence arises in a number of places in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra][abstract algebra]] (in particular, in the theory of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projector_(linear_algebra)][projectors]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_operator][closure operators]]) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming][functional programming]] (in which it is connected to the property of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency][referential transparency]]).

  The term was introduced by American mathematician [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Peirce][Benjamin Peirce]] in 1870 in the context of elements of algebras that remain invariant when raised to a positive integer power, and literally means "(the quality of having) the same power", from /[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/idem#Latin][idem]]/ + /[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/potence][potence]]/ (same + power).
